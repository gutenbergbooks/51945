      CHAPTER XX.&mdash;ON AN OAK SETTEE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>E was still
      pondering over the many aspects of the question which, to his mind, needed
      solution, when he returned to the Castle, to find Lord Fotheringay in a
      chair by the side of a gaunt old man who, at one period of his life, had
      probably been tall, but who was now stooped in a remarkable way. The
      stranger seemed very old, so that beside him Lord Fotheringay looked
      comparatively youthful. Of this fact no one was better aware than Lord
      Fotheringay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edmund Airey had seen portraits of the new guest, and did not require to
      be told that he was Julius Anthony Avon, the historian of certain periods.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first thought that occurred to him when he saw the two men side by
      side, was that Lord Fotheringay would not appear ridiculous merely as the
      son-in-law of Mr. Avon. To the casual observer at any rate he might have
      posed as the son of Mr. Avon.
    </p>
    <p>
      He himself seemed to be under the impression that he might pass as Mr.
      Avon&rsquo;s grandson, for he was extremely sportive in his presence,
      attitudinizing on his settee in a way that Edmund knew must have been
      agonizing to his rheumatic joints. Edmund smiled. He felt that he was
      watching the beginning of a comedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He learned that Mr. Avon had yielded to the persuasion of Lady Innisfail
      and had consented to join his daughter at the Castle for a few days. He
      was not fond of going into society; but it so happened that Castle
      Innisfail had been the centre of an Irish conspiracy at the early part of
      the century, and this fact made the acceptance by him of Lady Innisfail&rsquo;s
      invitation a matter of business.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hearing the nature of the work at which he was engaged, Lord Fotheringay
      had lost no time in expounding to him, in that airy style which he had at
      his command, the various mistakes that had been made by several
      generations of statesmen in dealing with the Irish question. The
      fundamental error which they had all committed was taking the Irish and
      their rebellions and conspiracies too seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      This theory he expounded to the man who was writing a biographical
      dictionary of Irish informers, and was about to publish his seventh
      volume, concluding the letter B.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Avon listened, gaunt and grim, while Lord Fotheringay gracefully waved
      away statesman after statesman who had failed signally, by reason of
      taking Ireland and the Irish seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something grim also in Edmund Airey&rsquo;s smile as he glanced at
      this beginning of the comedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night Miss Stafford added originality to the ordinary terrors of her
      recital. She explained that hitherto she had merely interpreted the verses
      of others: now, however, she would draw upon her store of original poems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, Edmund Airey was outside the drawingroom while this was going
      on. So were many of his fellow-guests, including Helen Craven. Edmund
      found her beside him in a secluded part of the hall. He was rather
      startled by her sudden appearance. He forgot to greet her with one of the
      clever things that he reserved for her and other appreciative young women&mdash;for
      he still found a few, as any man with a large income may, if he only keeps
      his eyes open. &ldquo;What a fool you must think me,&rdquo; were the words with which
      Miss Craven greeted him, so soon as he became aware of her presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strange to say, he had a definite idea that she had said something clever&mdash;at
      any rate something that impressed him more strongly than ever with the
      idea that she was a clever girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet she had assumed that he must think her a fool.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fool?&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;To think you so would be to write myself down one,
      Miss Craven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr Airey,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I am a woman. Long ago I was a girl. You will thus
      believe me when I tell you that I never was frank in all my life. I want
      to begin now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, now I know the drift of your remark,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;A fool. Yes, you made
      a good beginning: but supposing that I were to be frank, where would you
      be then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you to begin also, Mr Airey,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To begin? Oh, I made my start years ago&mdash;when I entered Parliament,&rdquo;
       said he. &ldquo;I was perfectly frank with the Opposition when I pointed out
      their mistakes. I have never yet been frank with a friend, however. That
      is why I still have a few left.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must be frank with me now; if you won&rsquo;t it doesn&rsquo;t matter: I&rsquo;ll be so
      to you. I admit that I behaved like an idiot; but you were responsible for
      it&mdash;yes, largely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a capital beginning. Now tell me what you have done or left
      undone&mdash;above all, tell me where my responsibility comes in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You like Harold Wynne?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You suggest that a mere liking involves a certain responsibility?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great heavens!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should you be startled at the confession when you have been aware of
      the fact for some time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never met a frank woman before. It is very terrible. Perhaps I shall
      get used to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why will you not drop that tone?&rdquo; she said, almost piteously. &ldquo;Cannot you
      see how serious the thing is to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is quite as serious to me,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Men have confided in me&mdash;mostly
      fools&mdash;a woman never. Pray do not continue in that strain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then find words for me&mdash;be frank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will. You mean to say, Miss Craven, that I think you a fool because,
      acting on the hint which I somewhat vaguely, but really in good faith,
      dropped, you tried to impersonate the figure of the legend at that
      ridiculous cave. Is not that what you would say if you had the courage to
      be thoroughly frank?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said she, in a still weaker voice. &ldquo;It is not so easy being
      frank all in a moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not if one has accustomed oneself to&mdash;let us say good manners,&rdquo;
       he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I started for the boats after you had all left for that nonsense at
      the village, I felt certain that you were my friend as well as Harold
      Wynne&rsquo;s, and that you had good reason for believing that he would be about
      the cave shortly after our hour of dining. I&rsquo;m not very romantic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;You are not quite frank. If you were you would say
      that, while secretly romantic, you follow the example of most young women
      nowadays in ridiculing romance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I admitted just now that I found it difficult to
      be frank all in a moment. Anyhow I believed that if I were to play the
      part of the Wraith of the Cave within sight of Harold Wynne, he might&mdash;oh,
      how could I have been such a fool? But you&mdash;you, I say, were largely
      responsible for it, Mr. Airey.&rdquo; She was now speaking not merely
      reproachfully but fiercely. &ldquo;Why should you drop those hints&mdash;they
      were much more than hints&mdash;about his being so deeply impressed with
      the romance&mdash;about his having gone to the cave on the previous
      evening, if you did not mean me to act upon them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did mean you to act upon them,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I meant that you and he
      should come together last night, and I know that if you had come together,
      he would have asked you to marry him. I meant all that, because I like him
      and I like you too&mdash;yes, in spite of your frankness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said she, giving him her hand. &ldquo;You forgive me for being
      angry just now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The woman who is angry with a man without cause pays him the greatest
      compliment in her power,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;Fate was against us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think that she is so very&mdash;very pretty?&rdquo; said Miss Craven.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She?&mdash;fate?&mdash;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I think. I think that Harold
      Wynne has met with the greatest misfortune of his life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you believe that, I know that I have met with the greatest of my
      life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The corner of the hall was almost wholly in shadow. The settee upon which
      Mr. Airey and Miss Craven were sitting, was cut off from the rest of the
      place by the thigh hone of the great skeleton elk. Between the ribs of the
      creature, however, some rays of light passed from one of the lamps; and,
      as Mr. Airey looked sympathetically into the face of his companion, he saw
      the gleam of a tear upon her cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was deeply impressed&mdash;so deeply that some moments had passed
      before he found himself wondering what she would say next. For a moment he
      forgot to be on his guard, though if anyone had described the details of a
      similar scene to him, he would probably have smiled while remarking that
      when the lamplight gleams upon a tear upon the cheek of a young woman of
      large experience, is just when a man needs most to be on his guard, He
      felt in another moment, however, that something was coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      He waited for it in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to him in that pause that he was seated by the side of someone
      whom he had never met before. The girl who was beside him seemed to have
      nothing in common with Helen Craven. So greatly does a young woman change
      when she becomes frank.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is why so many husbands declare&mdash;when they are also frank&mdash;that
      the young women whom they marry are in every respect different from the
      young women who promise to be their wives.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is going to happen?&rdquo; Helen asked him in a steady voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God knows,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw them together just after they left you this morning,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I
      was at one of the windows of the Castle, they were far along the terrace;
      but I&rsquo;m sure that he said something to her about her eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should not be surprised if he did,&rdquo; said Edmund. &ldquo;Her eyes invite
      comment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe that in spite of her eyes she is much the same as any other
      girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that to the point?&rdquo; he asked. He was a trifle disappointed in her last
      sentence. It seemed to show him that, whatever Beatrice might be, Helen
      was much the same as other girls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very much to the point,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;If she is like other girls she
      will hesitate before marrying a penniless man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I agree with you,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;But if she is like other girls she will not
      hesitate to love a penniless man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Possibly&mdash;if, like me, she can afford to do so. But I happen to know
      that she cannot afford it. This brings me up to what has been on my mind
      all day. You are, I know, my friend; you are Harold Wynne&rsquo;s also. Now, if
      you want to enable him to gratify his reasonable ambition&mdash;if you
      want to make him happy&mdash;to make me happy&mdash;you will prevent him
      from ever asking Beatrice Avon to marry him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I am prepared to do so much for him&mdash;for you&mdash;for her. But
      how can I do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can take her away from him. You know how such things are done. You
      know that if a distinguished man such as you are, with a large income such
      as you possess, gives a girl to understand that he is, let us say, greatly
      interested in her, she will soon cease to be interested in any
      undistinguished and penniless son of a reprobate peer who may be before
      her eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have seen such a social phenomenon,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Does your proposition
      suggest that I should marry the young woman with &lsquo;a gray eye or so&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may marry her if you please&mdash;that&rsquo;s entirely a matter for
      yourself. I don&rsquo;t see any need for you to go that length. Have I not kept
      my promise to be frank?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had risen from the settee. She laid her hand on one of his that rested
      on a projection of the old oak carving, and in another instant she was
      laughing in front of Norah Innisfail, who was rendered even more proper
      than usual through having become acquainted with Miss Stafford&rsquo;s notions
      of originality in verse-making.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI.&mdash;ON THE ELEMENTS OF PARTY POLITICS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>R. AIREY was
      actually startled by the suggestion which Miss Craven had made with, on
      the whole, considerable tact as well as inconceivable frankness.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been considering all the afternoon the possibility of carrying out
      the idea which it seemed Helen Craven had on her mind as well; but it had
      never occurred to him that his purpose might be achieved through the means
      suggested by the young woman who had just gone from his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      His first impression was that the proposal made to him was the cruellest
      that had ever come from one girl in respect of another girl. He had never
      previously had an idea that a girl could be so heartless as to make such a
      suggestion as that which had come from Helen Craven; but in the course of
      a short space of time, he found it expedient to revise his first judgment
      on this matter. Helen Craven meant to marry Harold&mdash;so much could
      scarcely be doubted&mdash;and her marrying him would be the best thing
      that could happen to him. She was anxious to prevent his marrying Miss
      Avon; and surely this was a laudable aim, considering that marrying Miss
      Avon would be the worst thing that could happen to him&mdash;and to Miss
      Avon as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      It might possibly be regarded as cruel by some third censors for Miss
      Craven to suggest that he, Edmund, after leading the other girl to believe
      that he was desirous of marrying her&mdash;or at least to believe that she
      might have a chance of marrying him&mdash;might stop short. To be sure,
      Miss Craven had not, with all her frankness, said that her idea was that
      he should refrain from asking the other girl to marry him, but only that
      the question was one that concerned himself alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought over this point for some time, and the conclusion he came to
      was that, after all, whether or not the cynical indifference of the
      suggestion amounted to absolute cruelty, the question concerned himself
      alone. Even if he were not to ask her to marry him after leading her to
      suppose that he intended doing so, he would at any rate have prevented her
      from the misery of marrying Harold; and that was something for which she
      might be thankful to him. He would also have saved her from the
      degradation of receiving a proposal of marriage from Lord Fotheringay; and
      that was also something for which she might be thankful to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being a strictly party politician, he regarded expediency as the greatest
      of all considerations. He was not devoid of certain scruples now and
      again; but he was capable of weighing the probable advantages of yielding
      to these scruples against the certain advantages of&mdash;well, of
      throwing them to the winds.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some minutes after Helen Craven had left him he subjected his scruples
      to the balancing process, and the result was that he found they were as
      nothing compared with the expediency of proceeding as Helen had told him
      that it was advisable for him to proceed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made up his mind that he would save the girl&mdash;that was how he put
      it to himself&mdash;and he would take extremely good care that he saved
      himself as well. Marriage would not suit him. Of this he was certain.
      People around him were beginning to be certain of it also. The mothers in
      Philistia had practically come to regard him as a <i>quantité négligeable</i>.
      The young women did not trouble themselves about him, after a while. It
      would not suit him to marry a young woman with lustrous eyes, he said to
      himself as he left his settee; but it would suit him to defeat the
      machinations of Lord Fotheringay, and to induce his friend Harold Wynne to
      pursue a sensible course.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found himself by the side of Beatrice Avon before five minutes had
      passed, and he kept her thoroughly amused for close upon an hour&mdash;he
      kept her altogether to himself also, though many chances of leaving his
      side were afforded the girl by considerate youths, and by one smiling
      person who had passed the first bloom of youth and had reached that which
      is applied by the cautious hare&rsquo;s foot in the hand of a valet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the hour of brandy-and-sodas and resplendent smoking-jackets had
      come, the fact of his having kept Beatrice Avon so long entertained had
      attracted some attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had attracted the attention of Miss Craven, who commented upon it with
      a confidential smile at Harold. It attracted the attention of Harold&rsquo;s
      father, who commented upon it with a leer and a sneer. It attracted the
      attention of Lady Innisfail, who commented upon it with a smile that
      caused the dainty dimple in her chin to assume the shape of the dot in a
      well-made note of interrogation.
    </p>
    <p>
      It also attracted the attention of quite a number of other persons, but
      they reserved their comments, which was a wise thing for them to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she said good-night to him, she seemed, Edmund Airey thought, to be a
      trifle fascinated as well as fascinating. He felt that he had had a
      delightful hour&mdash;it was far more delightful than the half hour which
      he had passed on the settee at the rear of the skeleton elk.
    </p>
    <p>
      His feeling in this matter simply meant that it was far more agreeable to
      him to see a young woman admiring his cleverness than it was to admire the
      cleverness of another young woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      He enjoyed his smoke by the side of the judge; for when a man is absorbed
      in the thoughts of his own cleverness he can still get a considerable
      amount of passive enjoyment out of the story of How the Odds fell from
      Thirteen to Five to Six to Four against Porcupine for some prehistoric
      Grand National.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harold Wynne now and again glanced across the hall at the man who
      professed to be his best friend. He could perceive without much trouble
      that Edmund Airey was particularly well pleased with himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      This meant, he thought, that Edmund had been particularly well pleased
      with Beatrice Avon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Fotheringay was too deeply absorbed in giving point to a story,
      founded upon personal experience, which he was telling to his host, to
      give a moment&rsquo;s attention to Edmund Airey, or to make an attempt to
      interpret his aspect.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was only when his valet was putting him carefully to bed&mdash;he
      required very careful handling&mdash;that he recollected the effective way
      in which Airey had snubbed him, when he had made an honest attempt to
      reach Miss Avon conversationally.
    </p>
    <p>
      He now found time to wonder what Airey meant by preventing the girl from
      being entertained&mdash;Lord Fotheringay assumed, as a matter of course,
      that the girl had not been entertained&mdash;all the evening. He had no
      head, however, for considering such a question in all its aspects. He only
      resolved that in future he would take precious good care that when there
      was any snubbing in the air, he would be the dispenser of it, not the
      recipient.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Fotheringay was not a man of genius, but upon occasions he could be
      quite as disagreeable as if he were. He had studied the art of
      administering snubs, and though he had never quite succeeded in snubbing a
      member of Parliament of the same standing as Mr. Airey, yet he felt quite
      equal to the duty, should he find it necessary to make an effort in this
      direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was sleeping the sleep of the reprobate, long before his son had
      succeeded in sleeping the sleep of the virtuous. Harold had more to think
      about, as well as more capacity of thinking, than his father. He was
      puzzled at the attitude of his friend and counsellor, Edmund Airey. What
      on earth could he have meant by appropriating Beatrice Avon, Harold
      wondered. He assumed that Airey had some object in doing what he had done.
      He knew that his friend was not the man to do anything without having an
      object in view. Previously he had been discreet to an extraordinary degree
      in his attitude toward women. He had never even made love to those matrons
      to whom it is discreet to make love. If he had ever done so Harold knew
      that he would have heard of it; for there is no fascination in making love
      to other men&rsquo;s wives, unless it is well known in the world that you are
      doing so. The school-boy does not smoke his cigarette in private. The
      fascination of the sin lies in his committing it so that it gets talked
      about.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, Airey had ever been discreet, Harold knew, and he quite failed to
      account for his lapse&mdash;assuming that it was indiscreet to appropriate
      Beatrice Avon for an hour, and to keep her amused all that time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harold himself had his own ideas of what was discreet in regard to young
      women, and he had acted up to them. He did not consider that, so far as
      the majority of young women were concerned, he should be accredited with
      much self-sacrifice for his discretion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had a great temperance movement been set on foot in Italy in the days of
      Cæsar Borgia, the total abstainers would not have earned commendation for
      their self-sacrifice. Harold Wynne had been discreet in regard to most
      women simply because he was afraid of them. He was afraid that he might
      some day be led to ask one of them to marry him&mdash;one of them whom he
      would regard as worse than a Borgia poison ever after.
    </p>
    <p>
      The caution that he had displayed in respect of Helen Craven showed how
      discreet he had accustomed himself to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      He reflected, however, that in respect of Beatrice Avon he had thrown
      discretion to the winds From the moment that he had drawn her hands to his
      by the fishing line, he had given himself up to her. He had been without
      the power to resist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Might it not, then, be the same with Edmund Airey? Might not Edmund, who
      had invariably been so guarded as to be wholly free from reproach so far
      as women were concerned, have found it impossible to maintain that
      attitude in the presence of Beatrice?
    </p>
    <p>
      And if this was so, what would be the result?
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the thought which kept Harold Wynne awake and uncomfortable for
      several hours during that night.

      CHAPTER XXII.&mdash;ON THE WISDOM OP THE MATRONS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">L</span>ADY INNISFAIL made
      a confession to one of her guests&mdash;a certain Mrs. Burgoyne&mdash;who
      was always delighted to play the <i>rôle</i> of receiver of confessions.
      The date at which Lady Innisfail&rsquo;s confession was made was three days
      after the arrival of Beatrice Avon at the Castle, and its subject was her
      own over-eagerness to secure a strange face for the entertainment of her
      guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought that the romantic charm which would attach to that girl, who
      seemed to float up to us out of the mist&mdash;leaving her wonderful eyes
      out of the question altogether&mdash;would interest all my guests,&rdquo; said
      she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so it did, if I may speak for the guests,&rdquo; said Mrs. Burgoyne. &ldquo;Yes,
      we were all delighted for nearly an entire day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad that my aims were not wholly frustrated,&rdquo; said Lady Innisfail.
      &ldquo;But you see the condition we are all in at present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot deny it,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Burgoyne, with a sigh. &ldquo;My dear, a new
      face is almost as fascinating as a new religion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More so to some people&mdash;generally men,&rdquo; said Lady Innisfail. &ldquo;But
      who could have imagined that a young thing like that&mdash;she has never
      been presented, she tells me&mdash;should turn us all topsy turvy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has a good deal in her favour,&rdquo; remarked Mrs. Burgoyne. &ldquo;She is
      fresh, her face is strange, she neither plays, sings, nor recites, and she
      is a marvellously patient listener.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That last comes through being the daughter of a literary man,&rdquo; said Lady
      Innisfail. &ldquo;The wives and daughters of poets and historians and the like
      are compelled to be patient listeners. They are allowed to do nothing
      else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say. Anyhow that girl has made the most of her time since she came
      among us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has. The worst of it is that no one could call her a flirt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose not. But what do you call a girl who is attractive to all men,
      and who makes all the men grumpy, except the one she is talking to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I call her a&mdash;a clever girl,&rdquo; replied Lady Innisfail. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t we all
      aim at that sort of thing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps we did&mdash;once,&rdquo; said Mrs. Burgoyne, who was a year or two
      younger than her hostess. &ldquo;I should hope that our aims are different now.
      We are too old, are we not?&mdash;you and I&mdash;for any man to insult us
      by making love to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A woman is never too old to be insulted, thank God,&rdquo; said Lady Innisfail;
      and Mrs. Burgoyne&rsquo;s laugh was not the laugh of a matron who is shocked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the same,&rdquo; added Lady Innisfail, &ldquo;our pleasant party threatens to
      become a fiasco, simply because I was over-anxious to annex a new face. I
      had set my heart upon bringing Harold Wynne and Helen Craven together; but
      now they have become hopelessly good friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is very kind to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s the worst of it; she is kind and he is indifferent&mdash;he
      treats her as if she were his favourite sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are matters so bad as that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite. But when the other girl is listening to what another man is saying
      to her, Harold Wynne&rsquo;s face is a study. He is as clearly in love with the
      other girl as anything can be. That, old reprobate&mdash;his father&mdash;has
      his aims too&mdash;horrid old creature! Mr. Durdan has ceased to study the
      Irish question with a deep-sea cast of hooks in his hand: he spends some
      hours every morning devising plans for spending as many minutes by the
      side of Beatrice. I do believe that my dear husband would have fallen a
      victim too, if I did not keep dinning into his ears that Beatrice is the
      loveliest creature of our acquaintance. I lured him on to deny it, and now
      we quarrel about it every night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe Lord Innisfail rather dislikes her,&rdquo; said Mrs. Burgoyne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m convinced of it,&rdquo; said Lady Innisfail. &ldquo;But what annoys me most is
      the attitude of Mr. Airey. He professed to be Harold&rsquo;s friend as well as
      Helen&rsquo;s, and yet he insists on being so much with Beatrice that Harold
      will certainly be led on to the love-making point&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he has not passed it already,&rdquo; suggested Mrs. Burgoyne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he has not passed it already; for I need scarcely tell you, my dear
      Phil, that a man does not make love to a girl for herself alone, but
      simply because other men make love to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that it is only natural that Harold should want to make love to
      Beatrice when he is led to believe that Edmund Airey wants to marry her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The young fool! Why could he not restrain his desire until Mr. Airey has
      married her? But do you really think that Mr. Airey does want to marry
      her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe that Harold Wynne believes so&mdash;that is enough for the
      present. Oh, no. You&rsquo;ll not find me quite so anxious to annex a strange
      face another time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From the report of this confidential duologue it may possibly be
      perceived, first, that Lady Innisfail was a much better judge of the
      motives and impulses of men than Miss Craven was; and, secondly, that the
      presence of Beatrice at the Castle had produced a marked impression upon
      the company beneath its roof.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was on the evening of the day after the confidential duologue just
      reported that there was an entertainment in the hall of the Castle. It
      took the form of <i>tableaux</i> arranged after well-known pictures, and
      there was certainly no lack of actors and actresses for the figures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary Queen of Scots was, of course, led to execution, and Marie
      Antoinette, equally as a matter of course, appeared in her prison. Then
      Miss Stafford did her best to realize the rapt young woman in Mr. Sant&rsquo;s
      &ldquo;The Soul&rsquo;s Awaking&rdquo;&mdash;Miss Stafford was very wide awake indeed, some
      scoffer suggested; and Miss Innisfail looked extremely pretty&mdash;a
      hostess&rsquo;s daughter invariably looks pretty&mdash;as &ldquo;The Peacemaker&rdquo; in
      Mr. Marcus Stone&rsquo;s picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beatrice Avon took no part in the <i>tableaux</i>&mdash;the other girls
      had not absolutely insisted on her appearing beside them on the stage that
      had been fitted up; they had an+ informal council together, Miss Craven
      being stage-manager, and they had come to the conclusion that they could
      get along very nicely without her assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of them said that Beatrice preferred flirting with the men. However
      this may have been, the fact remained that Harold, when he had washed the
      paint off his face&mdash;he had been the ill-tempered lover, Miss Craven
      being the young woman with whom he was supposed to have quarrelled,
      requiring the interposition of a sweet Peacemaker in the person of Miss
      Innisfail&mdash;went round by a corridor to the back of the hall, and
      stood for a few minutes behind a &lsquo;portiere that took the place of a door
      at one of the entrances. The hall was, of course, dimly lighted to make
      the contrast with the stage the greater, so that he could not see the
      features of the man who was sitting on the chair at the end of the row
      nearest the <i>portiere</i>; but the applause that greeted a reproduction
      of the picture of a monk shaving himself, having previously used no other
      soap than was supplied by a particular maker, had scarcely died away
      before Harold heard the voice of Edmund Airey say, in a low and earnest
      tone, to someone who was seated beside him, &ldquo;I do hope that before you go
      away, you will let me know where you will next pitch your tent. I don&rsquo;t
      want to lose sight of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you wish I shall let you know when I learn it from my father,&rdquo; was the
      reply that Harold heard, clearly spoken in the voice of Beatrice Avon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harold went back into the billowy folds of the tapestry curtain, and then
      into the corridor. The words that he had overheard had startled him. Not
      merely were the words spoken by Edmund Airey the same as he himself had
      employed a few days before to Beatrice, but her reply was practically the
      same as the reply which she had made to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the last of the figurantes had disappeared from the stage, and when
      the buzz of congratulations was sounding through the hall, now fully
      lighted, Harold was nowhere to be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only a few of the most earnest of the smokers were still in the hall when,
      long past midnight, he appeared at the door leading to the outer hall or
      porch. His shoes were muddy and his shirt front was pulpy, for the night
      was a wet one.
    </p>
    <p>
      He explained to his astonished friends that it was invariably the case
      that putting paint and other auxiliaries to &ldquo;making up&rdquo; on his face,
      brought on a headache, which he had learned by experience could only be
      banished by a long walk in the open air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, he had just had such a walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not expect that his explanation would carry any weight with it; and
      the way he was looked at by his friends made him aware of the fact that,
      in giving them credit for more sense than to believe him, he was doing
      them no more than the merest justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one who was present on his return placed the smallest amount of
      credence in his story. What many of them did believe was of no
      consequence.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII.&mdash;ON THE ATLANTIC.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE boats were
      scattered like milestones&mdash;as was stated by Brian&mdash;through the
      sinuous length of Lough Suangorm. The cutter yacht <i>Acushla</i> was
      leading the fleet out to the Atlantic, with two reefs in her mainsail, and
      although she towed a large punt, and was by no means a fast boat, she had
      no difficulty in maintaining her place, the fact being that the half-dozen
      boats that lumbered after her were mainly fishing craft hailing from the
      village of Cairndhu, and, as all the world knows, these are not built for
      speed but endurance. They are half-decked and each carries a lug sail. One
      of the legends of the coast is that when a lug sail is new its colour is
      brown, and as a new sail is never seen at Cairndhu there are no means of
      finding out if the story is true or false. The sails, as they exist, are
      kaleidoscopic in their patchwork. It is understood that anything will
      serve as a patch for a lug sail. Sometimes the centre-piece of an old coat
      has been used for this purpose; but if so, it is only fair to state that
      it is on record that the centre-piece of an old sail has been shaped into
      a jacket for the ordinary wearing of a lad.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lug sail may yet find its way into a drawing room in Belgravia and
      repose side by side with the workhouse sheeting which occupies an honoured
      place in that apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      On through the even waves that roll from between the headlands at the
      entrance, to the little strand of pebbles at the end of the lough, the
      boats lumbered. The sea and sky were equally gray, but now and again a
      sudden gleam of sunshine would come from some unsuspected rift in the
      motionless clouds, and fly along the crests of the waves, revealing a
      green transparency for an instant, and then, flashing upon the sails, make
      apparent every patch in their expanse, just as a flash of lightning on a
      dark night reveals for a second every feature of a broad landscape.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the first vessel of the little fleet, pursuing an almost direct course
      in spite of the curving of the shores of the Irish fjord, approached one
      coast and then the other, the great rocks that appeared snow-white, with
      only a dab of black here and there, became suddenly all dark, and the air
      was filled with what seemed like snow flakes. The cries of the innumerable
      sea birds, that whirled about the disturbing boat before they settled and
      the rocks became gradually white once more, had a remarkable effect when
      heard against that monotonous background, so to speak, of rolling waves.
    </p>
    <p>
      The narrow lough was a gigantic organ pipe through which the mighty bass
      of the Atlantic roared everlastingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when the headlands at the entrance were reached, the company who sat
      on the weather side of the cutter <i>Acushla</i> became aware of a
      commingling of sounds. The organ voice of the lough only filled up the
      intervals between the tremendous roar of the lion-throated waves that
      sprang with an appalling force half way up the black faces of the sheer
      cliffs, and broke in mid-air. All day long and all night long those
      inexhaustible billows come rushing upon that coast; and watching them and
      listening to them one feels how mean are contemporary politics as well as
      other things.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the Irish question,&rdquo; remarked Lord Innisfail, who was steering his
      own cutter.
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded in the direction of the waves that were clambering up the
      headlands. What he meant exactly he might have had difficulty in
      explaining.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very true, very true,&rdquo; said Mr. Durdan, sagaciously, hoping to provoke
      Mr. Airey to reply, and thinking it likely that he would learn from Mr.
      Airey&rsquo;s reply what was Lord Innisfail&rsquo;s meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. Airey, who had long ago become acquainted with Mr. Durdan&rsquo;s
      political methods, did not feel it incumbent on him to make the attempt to
      grapple with the question&mdash;if it was a question&mdash;suggested by
      Lord Innisfail.
    </p>
    <p>
      The metaphor of a host should not, he knew, be considered too curiously.
      Like the wit of a police-court magistrate, it should be accepted with
      effusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stand by that foresheet,&rdquo; said Lord Innisfail to one of the yacht&rsquo;s
      hands. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll heave to until the other craft come up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a few moments the cutter had all way off her, and was simply tumbling
      about among the waves in a way that made some of the ship&rsquo;s company hold
      their breath and think longingly of pale brandy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cruise of the <i>Acushla</i> and the appearance of the fleet of boats
      upon the lough were due to the untiring energy of Lady Innisfail and to
      the fact that at last Brian, the boatman, had, by the help of Father Conn,
      come to grasp something of the force of the phrase &ldquo;local colour&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Innisfail was anxious that her guests should carry away certain
      definite impressions of their sojourn at the Connaught castle beyond those
      that may be acquired at any country-house, which everyone knows may be
      comprised in a very few words. A big shoot, and an incipient scandal
      usually constitute the record of a country-house entertainment. Now, it
      was not that Lady Innisfail objected to a big shoot or an incipient
      scandal&mdash;she admitted that both were excellent in their own way&mdash;but
      she hoped to do a great deal better for her guests. She hoped to impart to
      their visit some local colour.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had hung on to the wake and the eviction, as has already been told,
      with pertinacity. The <i>fête</i> which she believed was known to the
      Irish peasantry as the Cruiskeen, had certainly some distinctive features;
      though just as she fancied that the Banshee was within her grasp, it had
      vanished into something substantial&mdash;this was the way she described
      the scene on the cliffs. Although her guests said they were very well
      satisfied with what they had seen and heard, adding that they had come to
      the conclusion that if the Irish had only a touch of humour they would be
      true to the pictures that had been drawn of them, still Lady Innisfail was
      not satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course if Mr. Airey were to ask Miss Avon to marry him, her house-party
      would be talked about during the winter. But she knew that it is the
      marriages which do not come off that are talked about most; and, after
      all, there is no local colour in marrying or giving in marriage, and she
      yearned for local colour. Brian, after a time, came to understand
      something of her ladyship&rsquo;s yearnings. Like the priest and the other
      inhabitants, he did not at first know what she wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is difficult to impress upon Fuzzy-wuzzy that he would be regarded as a
      person of distinction in the Strand and as an idol in Belgravia. At his
      home in the Soudan he is a very commonplace sort of person. So in the
      region of Lough Suangorm, but a casual interest attaches to the caubeen,
      which in Piccadilly would be followed by admiring crowds, and would
      possibly be dealt with in Evening Editions.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, as has just been said, Brian and his friends in due time came to
      perceive the spectacular value to her ladyship&rsquo;s guests of the most
      commonplace things of the country; and it was this fact that induced Brian
      to tell three stories of a very high colour to Mr. Airey and Mr. Wynne.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was also his appreciation of her ladyship&rsquo;s wants that caused him to
      suggest to her the possibility of a seal-hunt constituting an element of
      attraction&mdash;these were not the exact words employed by the boatman&mdash;to
      some of her ladyship&rsquo;s guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is scarcely necessary to say that Lady Innisfail was delighted with the
      suggestion. Some of her guests pretended that they also were delighted
      with it, though all that the majority wanted was to be let alone. Still,
      upon the afternoon appointed for the seal-hunt a considerable number of
      the Castle party went aboard the yacht. Beatrice was one of the few girls
      who were of the party. Helen would have dearly liked to go also; she would
      certainly have gone if she had not upon one&mdash;only one&mdash;previous
      occasion allowed herself to be persuaded to sail out to the headlands. She
      was wise enough not to imperil her prospects for the sake of being
      drenched with sea water.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wondered&mdash;she did not exactly hope it&mdash;if it was possible
      for Beatrice Avon to become seasick.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was how upon that gray afternoon, the fleet of boats sailed out to
      where the yacht was thumping about among the tremendous waves beyond the
      headlands that guard the entrance to Lough Suangorm.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIV.&mdash;ON THE CHANCE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HEN the fishing
      boats came within half a cable&rsquo;s length of the cutter, Lord Innisfail gave
      up the tiller to Brian, who was well qualified to be the organizer of the
      expedition, having the reputation of being familiar with the haunts and
      habits of the seals that may be found&mdash;by such as know as much about
      them as Brian&mdash;among the great caves that pierce for several miles
      the steep cliffs of the coast.
    </p>
    <p>
      The responsibility of steering a boat under the headlands, either North or
      South, was not sought by Lord Innisfail. For perhaps three hundred and
      fifty days in every year it would be impossible to approach the cliffs in
      any craft; but as Brian took the tiller he gave a knowing glance around
      the coast and assured his lordship that it was a jewel of a day for a
      seal-hunt, and added that it was well that he had brought only the largest
      of the fishing boats, for anything smaller would sink with the weight of
      the catch of seals.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took in the slack of the main sheet and sent the cutter flying direct
      to the Northern headland, the luggers following in her wake, though
      scarcely preserving stations or distances with that rigorous naval
      precision which occasionally sends an ironclad to the bottom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man-of-war may run upon a reef, and the country may be called on to
      pay half a million for the damage; but it can never be said that she fails
      to maintain her station prescribed by the etiquette of the Royal Navy in
      following the flagship, which shows that the British sailor, wearing
      epaulettes, is as true as the steel that his ship is made of, and a good
      deal truer than that of some of the guns which he is asked to fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a short time the boats had cleared the headland, and it seemed to some
      of the cutter&rsquo;s company as if they were given an opportunity of looking
      along the whole west coast of Ireland in a moment. Northward and
      southward, like a study in perspective, the lines of indented cliffs
      stretched until they dwindled away into the gray sky. The foam line that
      was curved as it curled around the enormous rocks close at hand, was
      straightened out in the distance and never quite disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Talk of the Great Wall of China,&rdquo; said Lord Innisfail, pointing proudly
      to the splendid chain of cliffs. &ldquo;Talk of the Great Wall of China indeed!
      What is it compared with that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke as proudly as if he owned everything within that line of cliffs,
      though he thanked heaven every night that he only owned a few thousand
      acres in Ireland.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What indeed&mdash;what indeed?&rdquo; said Mr. Durdan.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the men thought the moment opportune for airing a theory that he
      had to the effect that the Great Wall of China was not built by the
      Chinese to keep the surrounding nations out, but by the surrounding
      nations to keep the Chinese in.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a feasible theory, suggesting that the Chinese immigration question
      existed among the Thibetans some thousands of years ago, to quite as great
      an extent as it does in some other directions to-day. But it requires to
      be a very strong theory to stand the strain of the Atlantic waves and a
      practically unlimited view of the coast of Ireland. So no discussion
      arose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Already upon some of the flat rocks at the entrance to the great caves the
      black head of a seal might be seen. It did not remain long in view,
      however. Brian had scarcely pointed it out with a whisper to such persons
      as were near him, when it disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the wary boys they are, to be sure!&rdquo; he remarked confidentially.
    </p>
    <p>
      His boldness in steering among the rocks made some persons more than
      usually thoughtful. Fortunately the majority of those aboard the cutter
      knew nothing of his display of skill. They remained quite unaware of the
      jagged rocks that the boat just cleared; and when he brought the craft to
      the lee of a cliff, which formed a natural breakwater and a harbour of
      ripples, none of these people seemed surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Innisfail and a few yachtsmen who knew something of sailing, drew
      long breaths. They knew what they had escaped.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the hands got into the punt and took a line to the cliff to moor
      the yacht when the sails had been lowered, and by the time that the
      mooring was effected, the other boats had come into the natural harbour&mdash;it
      would have given protection&mdash;that is, natural protection, to a couple
      of ironclads&mdash;no power can protect them from their own commanders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, my lard,&rdquo; said Brian, who seemed at last to realize his
      responsibilities, &ldquo;all we&rsquo;ve got to do is to grab the craythurs; but that
      same&rsquo;s a caution. We&rsquo;ll be at least an hour-and-a-half in the caves, and
      as it will be cold work, and maybe wet work, maybe some of their honours
      wouldn&rsquo;t mind standing by the cutter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The suggestion was heartily approved of by some of the yacht&rsquo;s company.
      Lady Innisfail said she was perfectly satisfied with such local colour as
      was available without leaving the yacht, and it was understood that Miss
      Avon would remain by her side. Mr. Airey said he thought he could face
      with cheerfulness a scheme of existence that did not include sitting with
      varying degrees of uneasiness in a small boat while other men speared an
      inoffensive seal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such explanations are not for the Atlantic Ocean,&rdquo; said Harold, getting
      over the side of the yacht into the punt that Brian had hauled close&mdash;Lord
      Innisfail was already in the bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a short time, by the skilful admiralship of Brian, the other boats,
      which were brought up from the luggers, were manned, and their stations
      were assigned to them, one being sent to explore a cave a short distance
      off, while another was to remain at the entrance to pick up any seals that
      might escape. The same plan was adopted in regard to the great cave, the
      entrance to which was close to where the yacht was moored. Brian arranged
      that his boat should enter the cave, while another, fully manned, should
      stand by the rocks to capture the refugees.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the boats then started for their stations&mdash;all except the punt
      with Brian at the yoke lines, Harold and Mr. Durdan in the stern sheets,
      one of the hands at the paddles, and Lord Innisfail in the bows; for when
      this craft was about to push off, Brian gave an exclamation of discontent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter now?&rdquo; asked Lord Innisfail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plenty&rsquo;s the matter, my lard,&rdquo; said Brian. &ldquo;The sorra a bit of luck we&rsquo;ll
      have this day if we leave the ladies behind us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we must put up with bad luck,&rdquo; said Lord Innisfail. &ldquo;Go down on your
      knees to her ladyship and ask her to come with us if you think that will
      do any good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, her ladyship would come without prayers if she meant to,&rdquo; said Brian.
      &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s Miss Avon that&rsquo;s open to entreaty. For the love of heaven and
      the encouragement of sport, step into the boat, Sheila, and you&rsquo;ll have
      something to talk about for the rest of your life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Beatrice shook her head at the appeal, but that wouldn&rsquo;t do for Brian.
      &ldquo;Look, my lady, look at her eyes, aren&rsquo;t they just jumping out of her head
      like young trout in a stream in May?&rdquo; he cried to Lady Innisfail. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t
      she waiting for you to say the word to let her come, an&rsquo; not a word does
      any gentleman in the boat speak on her behalf.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gentlemen remained dumb, but Lady Innisfail declared that if Miss Avon
      was not afraid of a wetting and cared to go in the boat, there was no
      reason why she should not do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      In another moment Beatrice had stepped into the punt and it had pushed off
      with a cheer from Brian. The men in the other boats, now in the distance,
      hearing the cheer, but without knowing why it arose, sent back an answer
      that aroused the thousand echoes of the cliffs and the ten thousand sea
      birds that arose in a cloud from every crevice of the rocks. Thus it was
      that the approach of the boat to the great cave did not take place in
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harold had not uttered a word. He had not even looked at Edmund Airey&rsquo;s
      face to see what expression it wore when Beatrice stepped into the boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever hear anything like Airey&rsquo;s roundabout phrase about a scheme
      of existence?&rdquo; said Mr. Durdan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is his way of putting a simple matter,&rdquo; said Harold. &ldquo;You heard of the
      man who, in order to soften down the fact that a girl had what are
      colloquially known as beetle-crushers, wrote that her feet tended to
      increase the mortality among coleoptera?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that the days of the present government are numbered,&rdquo; said
      Mr. Durdan, who seemed to think that the remark was in logical sequence
      with Harold&rsquo;s story.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beatrice looked wonderingly at the speaker; it was some moments before she
      found an echo in the expression on Harold&rsquo;s face to what she felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man who could think of such things as the breaking up of a government,
      when floating in thirty fathoms of green sea, beneath the shadow of such
      cliffs as the boat was approaching, was a mystery to the girl, though she
      was the daughter of one of the nineteenth century historians, to whom
      nothing is a mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boat entered the great cave without a word being spoken by any one
      aboard, and in a few minutes it was being poled along in semi-darkness.
      The lapping of the swell from the entrance against the sides of the cave
      sounded on through the distance of the interior, and from those mysterious
      depths came strange sounds of splashing water, of dropping stalactites,
      and now and again a mighty sob of waves choked within a narrow vent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Silently the boat was forced onward, and soon all light from the entrance
      was obscured. Through total darkness the little craft crept for nearly
      half a mile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly a blaze of light shot up with startling effect in the bows of the
      boat. It only came from a candle that Brian had lit: but its gleam was
      reflected in millions of stalactites into what seemed an interminable
      distance&mdash;millions of stalactites on the roof and the walls, and
      millions of ripples beneath gave back the gleam, until the boat appeared
      to be the centre of a vast illumination.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dark shadows of the men who were using the oars as poles, danced about
      the brilliant roof and floor of the cave, adding to the fantastic charm of
      the scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Brian, in a whisper, &ldquo;these craythurs don&rsquo;t understand
      anything that&rsquo;s said to them unless by a human being, so we&rsquo;ll need to be
      silent enough. We&rsquo;ll be at the first ledge soon, and there maybe you&rsquo;ll
      wait with the lady, Mr. Wynne&mdash;you&rsquo;re heavier than Mr. Durdan, and
      every inch of water that the boat draws is worth thinking about. I&rsquo;ll
      leave a candle with you, but not a word must you speak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Harold. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the manager of the expedition; we must
      obey you; but I don&rsquo;t exactly see where my share in the sport comes in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d explain it all if I could trust myself to speak,&rdquo; said Brian. &ldquo;The
      craythurs has ears.&rdquo; The ledge referred to by him was reached in silence.
      It was perhaps six inches above the water, and in an emergency it might
      have afforded standing room for three persons. So much Harold saw by the
      light of the candle that the boatman placed in a niche of rock four feet
      above the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a sign from Brian, Harold got upon the ledge and helped Beatrice out of
      the boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The light of the candle that was in the bow of the boat gleamed upon the
      figure of a man naked from the waist up, and wearing a hard round hat with
      a candle fastened to the brim.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harold knew that this was the costume of the seal-hunter of the Western
      caves, for he had had a talk with Brian on the subject, and had learned
      that only by swimming with a lighted candle on his forehead for a quarter
      of a mile, the hunter could reach the sealing ground at the termination of
      the cave.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without a word being spoken, the boat went on, and its light soon
      glimmered mysteriously in the distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harold and Beatrice stood side by side on the narrow ledge of rock and
      watched the dwindling of the light. The candle that was on the niche of
      rock almost beside them seemed dwindling also. It had become the merest
      spark. Harold saw that Brian had inadvertently placed it so that the
      dripping of the water from the roof sent flecks of damp upon the wick.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stretched out his hand to shift it to another place, but before he
      could touch it, a large stalactite dropped upon it, and not only
      extinguished it, but sent it into the water with a splash.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little cry that came from the girl as the blackness of darkness closed
      upon them, sounded to his ears as a reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had not touched it,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Something dropped from the roof upon it.
      You don&rsquo;t mind the darkness?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no&mdash;no,&rdquo; said she, doubtfully. &ldquo;But we were commanded to be
      dumb.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That command was given on the assumption that the candle would continue
      burning&mdash;now the conditions are changed,&rdquo; said he, with a sophistry
      that would have done credit to a cabinet minister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a considerable pause before she asked him how long he thought it
      would be before the boat would return.
    </p>
    <p>
      He declined to bind himself to any expression of opinion on the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there was another pause, filled up only by the splash of something
      falling from the roof&mdash;by the wash of the water against the smooth
      rock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder how it has come about that I am given a chance of speaking to
      you at last?&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At last?&rdquo; said she, repeating his words in the same tone of inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say at last, because I have been waiting for such an opportunity for
      some time, but it did not come. I don&rsquo;t suppose I was clever enough to
      make my opportunity, but now it has come, thank God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again there was silence. He seemed to think that he had said something
      requiring a reply from her, but she did not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if you would believe me when I say that I love you,&rdquo; he
      remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she replied, as naturally as though he had asked her what she
      thought of the weather. &ldquo;Yes, I think I would believe you. If you did not
      love me&mdash;if I was not sure that you loved me, I should be the most
      miserable girl in all the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great God!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;You do not mean to say that you love me,
      Beatrice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you could only see my face now, you would know it,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;My eyes
      would tell you all&mdash;no, not all&mdash;that is in my heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He caught her hands, after first grasping a few handfuls of clammy rock,
      for the hands of the truest lovers do not meet mechanically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see them,&rdquo; he whispered&mdash;&ldquo;I see your eyes through the darkness. My
      love, my love!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not kiss her. His soul revolted from the idea of the commonplace
      kiss in the friendly secrecy of the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are opportunities and opportunities. He believed that if he had
      kissed her then she would never have forgiven him, and he was right. &ldquo;What
      a fool I was!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Two nights ago, when I overheard a man tell you,
      as I had told you long ago&mdash;so long ago&mdash;more than a week ago&mdash;that
      he did not want you to pass out of his sight&mdash;when I heard you make
      the same promise to him as you had made to me, I felt as if there was
      nothing left for me in the world. I went out into the darkness, and as I
      stood at the place when I first saw you, I thought that I should be doing
      well if I were to throw myself headlong down those rocks into the sea that
      the rain was beating upon. Beatrice, God only knows if it would be better
      or worse for you if I had thrown myself down&mdash;if I were to leave you
      standing alone here now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not say those words&mdash;they are like the words I asked you before
      not to say. Even then your words meant everything to me. They mean
      everything to me still.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gave a little laugh. Triumph rang through it. He did not seem to think
      that his laughter might sound incongruous to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is my hour,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Whatever fate may have in store for me it
      cannot make me unlive this hour. And to think that I had got no idea that
      such an hour should ever come to me&mdash;that you should ever come to me,
      my beloved! But you came to me. You came to me when I had tried to bring
      myself to feel that there was something worth living for in the world
      apart from love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now&mdash;and now&mdash;now I know that there is nothing but love
      that is worth living for. What is your thought, Beatrice&mdash;tell me all
      that is in your heart?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All&mdash;all?&rdquo; She now gave the same little laugh that he had given. She
      felt that her turn had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave just the same laugh when his feeling of triumph had given place
      to a very different feeling&mdash;when he had told her that he was a
      pauper&mdash;that he had no position in the world&mdash;that he was
      dependent upon his father for every penny that he had to spend, with the
      exception of a few hundred pounds a year, which he inherited from his
      mother&mdash;that it was an act of baseness on his part to tell her that
      he loved her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had plenty of time for telling her all this, and for explaining his
      position thoroughly, for nearly an hour had passed before a gleam of light
      and a hail from the furthest recesses of the cave, made them aware of the
      fact that other interests than theirs existed in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet when he had told her all that he had to tell to his disadvantage,
      she gave that little laugh of triumph. He would have given a good deal to
      be able to see the expression which he knew was in those wonderful eyes of
      hers, as that laugh came from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not being able to do so, however, he could only crush her hands against
      his lips and reply to the boat&rsquo;s hail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brian, on hearing of the mishap to the candle, delivered a torrent of
      execration against himself. It took Harold some minutes to bring himself
      up to the point of Lord Innisfail&rsquo;s enthusiasm on the subject of
      seal-fishing. Five excellent specimens were in the bottom of the boat, and
      the men who had swum after them were there also. A strong odour of whiskey
      was about them; and the general idea that prevailed was that they would
      not suffer from a chill, though they had been in the water for three
      quarters of an hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the other boats only succeeded in capturing three seals among them all,
      Brian had statistics to bear out his contention that the presence of
      Beatrice had brought luck to his boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pocketed two sovereigns which Harold handed him when the boats returned
      to the mooring-place, and he was more profuse than ever in his abuse of
      his own stupidity in placing the candle so as to be affected by the damp
      from the roof.
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes twinkled all the time in a way that made Harold&rsquo;s cheeks red.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge found Miss Avon somewhat <i>distraite</i> after dinner that
      night. He became pensive in consequence. He wondered if she thought him
      elderly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not mind in the least growing old, but the idea of being thought
      elderly was abhorrent to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day Beatrice and her father returned to their cottage at the
      other side of the lough.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXV.&mdash;ON THE SOCIAL VALUE OF THE REPROBATE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>OMETHING
      remarkable had occurred. Lord Fotheringay had been for a fortnight under
      one roof without disgracing himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The charitable people said he was reforming.
    </p>
    <p>
      The others said he was aging rapidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact remained the same, however: he had been a fortnight at the Castle
      and he had not yet disgraced himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Burgoyne congratulated Lady Innisfail upon this remarkable
      occurrence, and Lady Innisfail began to hope that it might get talked
      about. If her autumn party at Castle Innisfail were to be talked about in
      connection with the reform of Lord Fotheringay, much more interest would
      be attached to the party and the Castle than would be the result of the
      publication of the statistics of a gigantic shoot. Gigantic shoots did
      undoubtedly take place on the Innisfail Irish property, but they
      invariably took place before the arrival of Lord Innisfail and his guests,
      and the statistics were, for obvious reasons, not published. They only
      leaked out now and again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most commonplace people might enjoy the reputation attaching to the
      careful preservation and the indiscriminate slaughter of game; but Lady
      Innisfail knew that the distinction accruing from a connection with a
      social scandal of a really high order, or with a great social reform&mdash;either
      as regards a hardened reprobate or an afternoon toilet&mdash;was something
      much greater.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, she understood perfectly well that in England the Divorce Court
      is the natural and legitimate medium for attaining distinction in the form
      of a Special Edition and a pen and ink portrait; but she had seen great
      things accomplished by the rumour of an unfair game of cards, as well as
      by a very daring skirt dance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next to a high-class scandal, the discovery of a new religion was a means
      of reaching eminence, she knew. With the exact social value attaching to
      the Reform of a Hardened Reprobate, she was as yet unacquainted, the fact
      being that she had never had any experience of such an incident&mdash;it
      was certainly very rare in the society in which she moved, so that it is
      not surprising that she was not prepared to say at a moment how much it
      would count in the estimation of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if the Reform of a Reprobate&mdash;especially a reprobate with a title&mdash;was
      so rare as to be uncatalogued, so to speak, surely it should be of
      exceptional value as a social incident. Should it not partake of the
      prestige which attaches to a rare occurrence?
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the way that Mrs. Burgoyne put the matter to her friend and
      hostess, and her friend and hostess was clever enough to appreciate the
      force of her phrases. She began to perceive that although Lord Fotheringay
      had come to the Castle on the slenderest of invitations, and simply
      because it suited his purpose&mdash;although she had been greatly annoyed
      at his sudden appearance at the Castle, still good might come of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not venture to estimate from the standpoint of the moralist, the
      advantages accruing to the Reformed Reprobate himself from the incident of
      his reform, she merely looked at the matter from the standpoint of the
      woman of society&mdash;which is something quite different&mdash;desirous
      of attaining a certain social distinction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus it was that Lady Innisfail took to herself the credit of the Reform
      of the Reprobate, and petted the reprobate accordingly, giving no
      attention whatever to the affairs of his son. These affairs, interesting
      though they had been to her some time before, now became insignificant
      compared with the Great Reform.
    </p>
    <p>
      She even went the length of submitting to be confided in by Lord
      Fotheringay; and she heard, with genuine interest, from his own lips that
      he considered the world in general to be hollow. He had found it so. He
      had sounded the depths of its hollowness. He had found that in all grades
      of society there was much evil. The working classes&mdash;he had studied
      the question of the working man not as a parliamentary candidate,
      consequently honestly&mdash;drank too much beer. They sought happiness
      through the agency of beer; but all the beer produced by all the brewers
      in the House of Lords would not bring happiness to the working classes. As
      for the higher grades of society&mdash;the people who were guilty of
      partaking of unearned increment&mdash;well, they were wrong too. He
      thought it unnecessary to give the particulars of the avenues through
      which they sought happiness. But they were all wrong. The domestic life&mdash;there,
      and there only, might one find the elements of true happiness. He knew
      this because he had endeavoured to reach happiness by every other avenue
      and had failed in his endeavours. He now meant to supply his omission, and
      he regretted that it had never occurred to him to do so before. Yes, some
      poet or other had written something or other on the subject of the great
      charm of a life of domesticity, and Lord Fotheringay assured Lady
      Innisfail in confidence that that poet was right.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Innisfail sighed and said that the Home&mdash;the English Home&mdash;with
      its simple pleasures and innocent mirth, was where the Heart&mdash;the
      English Heart&mdash;was born. What happiness was within the reach of all
      if they would only be content with the Home! Society might be all very
      well in its way. There were duties to be discharged&mdash;every rank in
      life carried its duties with it; but how sweet it was, after one had
      discharged one&rsquo;s social obligations, to find a solace in the retirement of
      Home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Fotheringay lifted up his hands and said &ldquo;Ah&mdash;ah,&rdquo; in different
      cadences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Innisfail folded her hands and shook her head with some degree of
      solemnity. She felt confident that if Lord Fotheringay was in earnest, her
      autumn party would be talked about with an enthusiasm surpassing that
      which would attach to the comments on any of the big shoots in Scotland,
      or in Yorkshire, or in Wales.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when Lord Fotheringay had an opportunity of conversing alone with Mr.
      Airey, he did not think it necessary to dwell upon the delights which he
      had begun to perceive might be found in a life of pure domesticity. He
      took the liberty of reminding Mr. Airey of the conversation they had on
      the morning after Miss Avon&rsquo;s arrival at the Castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had we a conversation then, Lord Fotheringay?&rdquo; said Mr. Airey, in a tone
      that gave Lord Fotheringay to understand that if any contentious point was
      about to be discussed, it would rest with him to prove everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, we had a conversation,&rdquo; said Lord Fotheringay. &ldquo;I was foolish enough
      to make a confidant of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you did so, you certainly were foolish,&rdquo; said Edmund, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been keeping my eyes open and my ears open as well, during the
      past ten days,&rdquo; said Lord Fotheringay, with a leer that was meant to be
      significant. Edmund Airey, however, only took it to signify that Lord
      Fotheringay could easily be put into a very bad temper. He said nothing,
      but allowed Lord Fotheringay to continue. &ldquo;Yes, let me tell you that when
      I keep both eyes and ears open not much escapes me. I have seen and heard
      a good deal. You are a clever sort of person, friend Airey; but you don&rsquo;t
      know the world as I know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no&mdash;as you know it&mdash;ah, no,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Airey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Fotheringay was a trifle put out by the irritating way in which the
      words were spoken. Still, the pause he made was not of long duration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have your game to play, like other people, I suppose,&rdquo; he resumed,
      after the little pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are at liberty to suppose anything you please, my dear Lord
      Fotheringay,&rdquo; said Mr. Airey, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said Lord Fotheringay, adopting quite another tone. &ldquo;Come, Airey,
      speaking as man to man, wasn&rsquo;t it a confoundedly shabby trick for you to
      play upon me&mdash;getting me to tell you that I meant to marry that young
      thing&mdash;to save her from unhappiness, Airey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Airey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Lord Fotheringay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t complete your sentence. Was the shabby trick accepting your
      confidence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The shabby trick was trying to win the affection of the young woman after
      I had declared to you my intention.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was the shabby trick, was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no hesitation in saying that it was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. I hope that you have nothing more to confide in me beside this&mdash;your
      confidences have so far been singularly uninteresting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Fotheringay got really angry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me tell you&mdash;&rdquo; he began, but he was stopped by Airey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I decline to let you tell me anything,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;You accused me just
      now of being so foolish as to listen to your confidences. I, perhaps,
      deserved the reproach. But I should be a fool if I were to give you
      another chance of levelling the same accusation against me. You will have
      to force your confidences on someone else in future, unless such as
      concern your liver. You confided in me that your liver wasn&rsquo;t quite the
      thing. How is it to-day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand your tactics,&rdquo; said Lord Fotheringay, with a snap. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll
      take good care to make others acquainted with them also,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;Oh,
      no, Mr. Airey; I wasn&rsquo;t born yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To that fact every Peerage in the kingdom bears testimony,&rdquo; said Mr.
      Airey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Fotheringay had neglected his cigar. It had gone out. He now took
      three or four violent puffs at it; he snapped it from between his teeth,
      looked at the end, and then dropped it on the ground and stamped on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was your own fault,&rdquo; said Airey. &ldquo;Try one of mine, and don&rsquo;t bother
      yourself with other matters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bother myself with what I please,&rdquo; said Lord Fotheringay with a
      snarl.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he took Mr. Airey&rsquo;s cigar, and smoked it to the end. He knew that Mr.
      Airey smoked Carolinas.
    </p>
    <p>
      This little scene took place outside the Castle before lunch on the second
      day after the departure of Mr. Avon and his daughter; and, after lunch,
      Lord Fotheringay put on a yachting jacket and cap, and announced his
      intention of having a stroll along the cliffs. His doctor had long ago
      assured him, he said, that he did not take sufficient exercise nor did he
      breathe enough fresh air. He meant in future to put himself on a strict
      regimen in this respect, and would begin at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was allowed to carry out his intention alone&mdash;indeed he did not
      hint that his medical adviser had suggested company as essential to the
      success of any scheme of open air exercise.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day was a breezy one, and the full force of the wind was felt at the
      summit of the cliff coast; but like many other gentlemen who dread being
      thought elderly, he was glad to seize every opportunity of showing that he
      was as athletic as the best of the young fellows; so he strode along,
      gasping and blowing with quite as much fresh air in his face as the most
      exacting physician could possibly have prescribed for a single dose.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made his way to the mooring-place of the boats, and he found Brian in
      the boat-house engaged in making everything snug.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was very civil to Brian, and after a transfer of coin, inquired about
      the weather.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a bit of a draught of wind in the lough, Brian said, but it was
      a fine day for a sail. Would his lardship have a mind for a bit of a sail?
      The <i>Acushla</i> was cruising, but the <i>Mavourneen</i>, a neat little
      craft that sailed like a swallow, was at his lardship&rsquo;s service.
    </p>
    <p>
      After some little consideration, Lord Fotheringay said that though he had
      no idea of sailing when he left the Castle, yet he never could resist the
      temptation of a fine breeze&mdash;it was nothing stronger than a breeze
      that was blowing, was it?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A draught&mdash;just a bit of a draught,&rdquo; said the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; said Lord Fotheringay, &ldquo;I think I may venture. In fact,
      now that I come to think of it, I should like to visit the opposite shore.
      There is a Castle or something, is there not, on the opposite shore?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it a Castle?&rdquo; said Brian. &ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s a power of Castles scattered
      along the other shore, my lard. It&rsquo;s thrippin&rsquo; over them your lardship
      will be after doin.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll not lose a moment in starting,&rdquo; said Lord Fotheringay.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVI.&mdash;ON FRANKNESS AND FRIENDSHIP.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span>RIAN took care
      that no moment was lost. In the course of a very few minutes Lord
      Fotheringay was seated on the windward thwarts of the boat, his hands
      grasping the gunwale to right and left, and his head bowed to mitigate in
      some measure the force of the shower of sea-water that flashed over the
      boat as her hows neatly clipped the crest off every wave.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Fotheringay held on grimly. He hated the sea and all connected with
      it; though he hated the House of Lords to almost as great an extent, yet
      he had offered the promoter of the Channel Tunnel to attend in the House
      and lend the moral weight of his name to the support of the scheme. It was
      only the breadth and spontaneousness of Brian&rsquo;s assurance that the breeze
      was no more than a draught, that had induced him to carry out his
      cherished idea of crossing the lough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell your lardship that the boat could sail with the best of
      them?&rdquo; said the man, as he hauled in the sheet a trifle, and brought the
      boat closer to the wind&mdash;a manouvre that did not tend to lessen the
      cascade that deluged his passenger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Fotheringay said not a word. He kept his head bowed to every flap of
      the waves beneath the bows. His attitude would have commended itself to
      any painter anxious to produce a type of Submission to the Will of Heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was aging quickly&mdash;so much Brian perceived, and dwelt upon&mdash;with
      excellent effect&mdash;in his subsequent narrative of the voyage to some
      of the servants at the Castle. The cosmetic that will withstand the
      constant application of sea-water has yet to be invented, so that in half
      an hour Lord Fotheringay would not have been recognized except by his
      valet. Brian had taken aboard a well-preserved gentleman with a rosy
      complexion and a moustache almost too black for nature. The person who
      disembarked at the opposite side of the lough was a stooped old man with
      lank streaky cheeks and a wisp of gray hair on each side of his upper lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s a fine sailor your lardship is entirely,&rdquo; remarked the boatman,
      as he lent his tottering, dazed passenger a helping hand up the beach of
      pebbles. &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s raal enjoyment your lardship will be after having among
      the Castles of the ould quality, after your lardship&rsquo;s sail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not a word did Lord Fotheringay utter. He felt utterly broken down in
      spirit, and it was not until he had got behind a rock and had taken out a
      pocket-comb and a pocket-glass, and had by these auxiliaries, and the
      application of a grain or two of roseate powder without which he never
      ventured a mile from his base of supplies, repaired some of the ravages of
      his voyage, that he ventured to make his way to the picturesque white
      cottage, which Miss Avon had once pointed out to him as the temporary
      residence of her father and herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a five-roomed cottage that had been built and furnished by an
      enthusiastic English fisherman for his accommodation during his annual
      residence in Ireland. One, more glance did Lord Fotheringay give to his
      pocket-mirror before knocking at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would have had time to renew his youth, had he had his pigments handy,
      before the door was opened by an old woman with a shawl over her shoulders
      and a cap, that had possibly once been white, on her straggling hairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      She made the stage courtesy of an old woman in front of Lord Fotheringay,
      and explained that she was a little hard of hearing&mdash;she was even
      obliging enough to give a circumstantial account of the accident that was
      responsible for her infirmity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Avon?&rdquo; said the old woman, when Lord Fotheringay had repeated his
      original request in a louder tone. &ldquo;Miss Avon? no, she&rsquo;s not here now&mdash;not
      even her father, who was a jewel of a gentleman, though a bit queer. God
      bless them both now that they have gone back to England, maybe never to
      return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Back to England. When?&rdquo; shouted Lord Fotheringay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, since early in the morning. The Blessed Virgin keep the young lady
      from harm, for she&rsquo;s swater than honey, and the Saints preserve her
      father, for he was&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Fotheringay did not wait to hear the position of the historian
      defined by the old woman. He turned away from the door with such words as
      caused her infirmity to be a blessing in disguise.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Brian greeted his return with a few well-chosen phrases bearing upon
      the architecture of the early Celtic nobles, Lord Fotheringay swore at
      him; but the boatman, who did a little in that way himself when under
      extreme provocation, only smiled as Lord Fotheringay took his seat in the
      boat once more, and prepared for the ordeal of his passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a good deal in Brian&rsquo;s smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wind had changed most unaccountably, he explained, so that it would,
      he feared, be absolutely necessary to tack out almost to the entrance of
      the lough in order to reach the mooring-place. For the next hour he became
      the exponent of every system of sailing known to modern navigators. After
      something over an hour of this manoeuvring, he had compassion upon his
      victim, and ran the boat before the wind&mdash;he might have done so at
      first if Lord Fotheringay had not shown such a poor knowledge of men as to
      swear at him&mdash;to the mooring-place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s not making too free with your lardship, I&rsquo;d offer your lardship a
      hand up the track,&rdquo; said Brian. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s myself that has to go up to the
      Castle anyway, with a letter to her ladyship from Miss Avon. Didn&rsquo;t the
      young lady give it to me in the morning before she started with his honour
      her father on the car?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you knew all this time that Miss Avon and her father had left the
      neighbourhood?&rdquo; said Lord Fotheringay, through his store teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tubbe sure I did,&rdquo; said Brian. &ldquo;But Miss Avon didn&rsquo;t live in one of the
      Castles of the ould quality that your lardship was so particular ready to
      explore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Fotheringay felt that his knowledge of the world and the dwellers
      therein had its limits.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at Lord Fotheringay&rsquo;s bedside that Harold said his farewell to his
      father the next day. Lord Fotheringay&rsquo;s incipient rheumatism had been
      acutely developed by his drenching of the previous afternoon, and he
      thought it prudent to remain in bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going, are you?&rdquo; snarled the Father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m going,&rdquo; replied the Son. &ldquo;Lord and Lady Innisfail leave
      to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you asked Miss Craven to marry you?&rdquo; inquired the Father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Harold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not&mdash;tell me that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t made up my mind on the subject of marrying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then the sooner you make it up the better it will be for yourself. I&rsquo;ve
      been watching you pretty closely for some days&mdash;I did not fail to
      notice a certain jaunty indifference to what was going on around you on
      the night of your return from that tomfoolery in the boats&mdash;seal-hunting,
      I think they called it. I saw the way you looked at Helen Craven that
      night. Contempt, or something akin to contempt, was in every glance. Now
      you know that she is to be at Ella&rsquo;s in October. You have thus six weeks
      to make up your mind to marry her. If you make up your mind to marry
      anyone else, you may make up your mind to live upon the three hundred a
      year that your mother left you. Not a penny you will get from me. I&rsquo;ve
      stinted myself hitherto to secure you your allowance. By heavens, I&rsquo;ll not
      do so any longer. You will only receive your allowance from me for another
      year, and then only by signing a declaration at my lawyer&rsquo;s to the effect
      that you are not married. I&rsquo;ve heard of secret marriages before now, but
      you needn&rsquo;t think of that little game. That&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ve to say to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it is enough,&rdquo; said Harold. &ldquo;Good-bye.&rdquo; He left the room and then he
      left the Castle, Lady Innisfail only shaking her head and whispering, &ldquo;You
      have disappointed me,&rdquo; as he made his adieux.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day all the guests had departed&mdash;all, with the exception of
      Lord Fotheringay, who was still too ill to move. In the course of some
      days, however, the doctor thought that he might without risk&mdash;except,
      of course, such as was incidental to the conveyance itself&mdash;face a
      drive on an outside car, to the nearest railway-station.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before leaving him, as she was compelled to do owing to her own
      engagements, Lady Innisfail had another interesting conversation&mdash;it
      almost amounted to a consultation&mdash;with her friend Mrs. Burgoyne on
      the subject of the Reform of the Hardened Reprobate. And the result of
      their further consideration of the subject from every standpoint, was to
      induce them to believe that, with such a powerful incentive to the Higher
      Life as an acute rheumatic attack, Lord Fotheringay&rsquo;s reform might safely
      be counted on. It might, at any rate, be freely discussed during the
      winter. If, subsequently, he should become a backslider, it would not
      matter. His reform would have gone the way of all topics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen Craven and Edmund Airey had also a consultation together on the
      subject upon which they had previously talked more than once.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each of them showed such an anxiety to give prominence to the circumstance
      that they were actuated solely for Harold&rsquo;s benefit in putting into
      practice the plan which one of them had suggested, it was pretty clear
      that they had an uneasy feeling that they required some justification for
      the course which they had thought well to pursue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, they agreed that Harold should be placed beyond the power of his
      father. Mr. Airey said he had never met a more contemptible person than
      Lord Fotheringay, and for the sake of making Harold independent of such a
      father, he would, he declared, do again all that he had done during the
      week of Miss Avon&rsquo;s sojourn at the Castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was, indeed, sad, Miss Craven felt, that Harold should have such a
      father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it was because I felt this so strongly that I&mdash;I&mdash;well,
      I began to ask myself if there might not be some way of escape for him,&rdquo;
       said she, in a pensive tone that was quite different from the tone of the
      frank communication that she had made to Mr. Airey some time before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can quite understand that,&rdquo; said Edmund. &ldquo;Well, though Harold hasn&rsquo;t
      shown himself to be wise&mdash;that is&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We both know what that means,&rdquo; said she, anticipating his definition of
      wisdom so far as Harold was concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We do,&rdquo; said Edmund. &ldquo;If he has not shown himself to be wise in this way,
      he has not shown himself to be a fool in another way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose he has not,&rdquo; said she, thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great heavens! you don&rsquo;t mean to think that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That he has told Beatrice Avon that he loves her? No, I don&rsquo;t fancy that
      he has, still&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I thought that, on their return from that awful seal-hunt, I saw a
      change in both of them. It seemed to me that&mdash;that&mdash;well, I
      don&rsquo;t quite know how I should express it. Haven&rsquo;t you seen a thirsty look
      on a man&rsquo;s face?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A thirsty look? I believe I have seen it on a woman&rsquo;s face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may be the same. Well, Harold Wynne&rsquo;s face wore such an expression for
      days before the seal-hunt&mdash;I can&rsquo;t say that I noticed it on Beatrice
      Avon&rsquo;s face at the same time; but so soon as they returned from the boats
      on that evening, I noticed the change on Harold&rsquo;s&mdash;perhaps it was
      only fancy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am inclined to believe that it was fancy. In my belief none of us was
      quite the same after that wild cruise. I was beside Miss Avon all the time
      that we were sailing out to the caves, and though she and Harold were in
      the boat together, yet Lord Innisfail and Durdan were in the same boat
      also. I can&rsquo;t see how they could have had any time for an understanding
      while they were engaged in looking after the seals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Craven shook her head doubtfully. It was clear that she was a
      believer in the making of opportunities in such matters as those which
      they were discussing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anyhow, we have done all that we could reasonably be expected to do,&rdquo;
       said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And perhaps a trifle over,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;If it were not that I like Harold
      so much&mdash;and you, too, my dear&rdquo;&mdash;this seemed an afterthought&mdash;&ldquo;I
      would not have done all that I have done. It is quite unlikely that Miss
      Avon and I shall be under the same roof again, but if we should be, I
      shall, you may be certain, find out from her whether or not an
      understanding exists between her and Harold. But what understanding could
      it be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Craven smiled. Was this the man who had made such a reputation for
      cleverness, she asked herself&mdash;a man who placed a limit on the
      opportunities of lovers, and then inquired what possible understanding
      could be come to between a penniless man and a girl with &ldquo;a gray eye or
      so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What understanding?&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Why, he may have unfolded to her a scheme
      for becoming Lord High Chancellor after two year&rsquo;s hard work at the bar,
      with a garden-party now and again; or for being made a Bishop in the same
      time; and their understanding may be to wait for one another until the
      arrival of either event. Never mind. We have done our best for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For them,&rdquo; said Edmund.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, he tried to bring himself to believe that all that he had done was
      for the benefit of his friend Harold and for his friend Beatrice&mdash;to
      say nothing of his friend Helen as well. After a time he did almost force
      himself to believe that there was nothing that was not strictly honourable
      in the endeavour that he had made, at Helen&rsquo;s suggestion, to induce
      Beatrice Avon to perceive the possibility of her obtaining a proposal of
      marriage from a rich and distinguished man, if she were only to decline to
      afford the impecunious son of a dissolute peer an opportunity of telling
      her that he loved her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now and again, however, he had an uneasy twinge, as the thought occurred
      to him that if some man, understanding the exact circumstances of the
      case, were to be as frank with him as Helen Craven had been (once), that
      man might perhaps be led to say that he had been making a fool of Beatrice
      for the sake of gratifying his own vanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was just possible, and he knew it, that that frank friend&mdash;assuming
      that frankness and friendship may exist together&mdash;might be disposed
      to give prominence in this matter to the impulses of vanity, to the
      exclusion of the impulses of friendship, and a desire to set the crooked
      straight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even the fortnight which he spent in Norway with one of the heads of the
      Government party&mdash;a gentleman who would probably have shortly at his
      disposal an important Under-Secretaryship&mdash;failed quite to abate
      these little twinges that he had when he reflected upon the direction that
      might be taken by a frank friend, in considering the question of the
      responsibility involved in his attitude toward Miss Avon.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was just a week after Lord Fotheringay had left Castle Innisfail that a
      stranger appeared in the neighbourhood&mdash;a strange gentleman with the
      darkest hair and the fiercest eyes ever seen, even in that region of dark
      hair and eyes. He inquired who were the guests at the Castle, and when he
      learned that the last of them&mdash;a distinguished peer named Lord
      Fotheringay&mdash;had gone some time, and that it was extremely unlikely
      that the Castle would be open for another ten months, his eyes became
      fiercer than ever. He made use of words in a strange tongue, which Brian
      declared, if not oaths, would do duty for oaths without anyone being the
      wiser.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger departed as mysteriously as he had come.

      CHAPTER XXVII.&mdash;ON CIRCUMVENTING A STAG.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>F Edmund Airey had
      a good deal to think about in Norway, Harold Wynne was certainly not
      without a subject for thought in Scotland.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was with a feeling of exultation that he had sat in the bows of the
      cutter <i>Acushla</i> on her return to her moorings after that seal-hunt
      which everyone agreed had been an extraordinary success. Had this
      expression of exultation been noticed by Lady Innisfail, it would,
      naturally, have been attributed by her to the fact that he had been in the
      boat that had made the largest catch of seals. To be sure, Miss Craven,
      who had observed at least a change in the expression upon his face, did
      not attribute it to his gratification on having slaughtered some seals,
      but then Miss Craven was more acute than an ordinary observer.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt that he did well to be exultant, as he looked at Beatrice Avon
      standing by the side of Lord Innisfail at the tiller. The wind that filled
      the mainsail came upon her face and held her garments against her body,
      revealing every gracious curve of her shape, and suggesting to his eyes a
      fine piece of sculpture with flying drapery.
    </p>
    <p>
      And she was his.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to him when he had begun to speak to her in the solemn darkness
      of the seal-cave, that it was impossible that he could receive any answer
      from her that would satisfy him. How was it possible that she could love
      him, he had asked himself at some agonizing moments during the week. He
      thought that she might possibly have come to love him in time, if she had
      not been with him in the boat during that night of mist, when the voice of
      Helen Craven had wailed round the cliffs. Her arrival at the Castle could
      not but have revealed to her the fact that she might obtain an offer of
      marriage from someone who was socially far above him; and thus he had
      almost lost all hope of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet she was his.
    </p>
    <p>
      The course adopted by his friend Edmund Airey had astonished him. He could
      not believe that Airey had fallen in love with her. It was not consistent
      with Airey&rsquo;s nature to fall in love with anyone, he believed. But he knew
      that in the matter of falling in love, people do not always act
      consistently with their character; so that, after all, Airey might be only
      waiting an opportunity to tell her that he had fallen in love with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The words that he had overheard Airey speak to her upon the night of the
      <i>tableaux</i> in the hall&mdash;words that had driven him out into the
      night of rain and storm to walk madly along the cliffs, and to wonder if
      he were to throw himself into the waves beneath, would he be strong enough
      to let himself sink into their depths or weak enough to make a struggle
      for life&mdash;those words had cleared away whatever doubts he had
      entertained as to Edmund&rsquo;s intentions.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet she was his.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had answered his question so simply and clearly&mdash;with such
      earnestness and tenderness as startled him. It seemed that they had come
      to love each other, as he had read of lovers doing, from the first moment
      that they had met. It seemed that her love had, like his, only increased
      through their being kept apart from each other&mdash;mainly by the clever
      device of Miss Craven and the co-operation of Edmund Airey, though, of
      course, Harold did not know this.
    </p>
    <p>
      His reflections upon this marvel&mdash;the increase of their love, though
      they had few opportunities of being together and alone&mdash;would have
      been instructive even to persons so astute and so ready to undertake the
      general control of events as Mr. Airey and Miss Craven. Unfortunately,
      however, they were as ignorant of what had taken place to induce these
      reflections as he was of the conspiracy between them to keep him apart
      from Beatrice to secure his happiness and the happiness of Beatrice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact that Beatrice loved him and had confessed her love for him,
      though they had had so few opportunities of being together, seemed to him
      the greatest of all the marvels that he had recently experienced.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he gave a farewell glance at the lough and recollected how, a fortnight
      before, he had walked along the cliffs and had cast to the winds all his
      cherished ideas of love, he could not help feeling that he had been
      surrounded with marvels. He had had a narrow escape&mdash;he actually
      regarded a goodlooking young woman with several thousands of pounds of an
      income, as a narrow escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the last of the reflections that came to him with the sound of
      the green seas choked in the narrows of the lough.
    </p>
    <p>
      The necessity of preserving himself from sudden death&mdash;the Irish
      outside car on which he was driving was the worst specimen he had yet seen&mdash;absorbed
      all his thoughts when he had passed through the village of Ballycruiskeen;
      and by the time he had got out of the train that carried him to the East
      Coast&mdash;a matter of six hours travelling&mdash;and aboard the steamer
      that bore him to Glasgow, the exultation that he had felt on leaving
      Castle Innisfail, and on reflecting upon the great happiness that had come
      to him, was considerably chastened.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was due at two houses in Scotland. At the first he meant to do a little
      shooting. The place was not inaccessible. After a day&rsquo;s travelling he
      found himself at a railway station fifteen miles from his destination. He
      eventually reached the place, however, and he had some shooting, which,
      though indifferent, was far better than it was possible to obtain on Lord
      Innisfail&rsquo;s mountains&mdash;at least for Lord Innisfail&rsquo;s guests to
      obtain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second place was still further north&mdash;it was now and again
      alluded to as the North Pole by some visitors who had succeeded in finding
      their way to it, in spite of the directions given to them by the various
      authorities on the topography of the Highlands. Several theories existed
      as to the best way of reaching this place, and Harold, who knew sufficient
      Scotch to be able to take in the general meaning of the inhabitants
      without the aid of an interpreter, was made aware while at the shooting
      lodge, of these theories. Hearing, however, that some persons had actually
      been known to find the place, he felt certain that they had struck out an
      independent course for themselves. It was incredible to him that any of
      them had reached it by following the directions they had received on the
      subject. He determined to follow their example; and he had reached the
      place&mdash;eventually.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was when he had been for three days following a stag, that he began to
      think of his own matters in a dispassioned way. Crawling on one&rsquo;s stomach
      along a mile or two of boggy land and then wriggling through narrow spaces
      among the rocks&mdash;sitting for five or six hours on gigantic sponges
      (damp) of heather, with one&rsquo;s chin on one&rsquo;s knees for strategical
      purposes, which the gillies pretend they understand, but which they keep a
      dead secret&mdash;shivering as the Scotch mist clothes one as with a wet
      blanket, then being told suddenly that there is a stag thirty yards to
      windward&mdash;getting a glimpse of it, missing it, and then hearing the
      gillies exchanging remarks in a perfectly intelligible Gaelic regarding
      one&rsquo;s capacity&mdash;these incidents constitute an environment that tends
      to make one look dispassionately upon such marvels as Harold had been
      considering in a very different spirit while the Irish lough was yet
      within hearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the third day that he had been trying to circumvent the stag, Harold
      felt despondent&mdash;not about the stag, for he had long ago ceased to
      take any interest in the brute&mdash;but about his own future.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is to be regretted (sometimes) that an exchange of sentiments on the
      subject of love between lovers does not bring with it a change of
      circumstances, making possible the realization of a scheme of life in
      which those sentiments shall play an active part&mdash;or at least as
      active a part as sentiments can play. This was Harold&rsquo;s great regret.
      Since he had found that he loved Beatrice and that Beatrice loved him, the
      world naturally appeared lovelier also. But it was with the loveliness of
      a picture that hangs in a public gallery, not as an individual possession.
    </p>
    <p>
      His material circumstances, so far from having improved since he had
      confessed to Edmund Airey that it was necessary for him to marry a woman
      with money, had become worse; and yet he had given no thought to the young
      woman with the money, but a great many thoughts to the young woman who
      had, practically, none. He felt that no more unsatisfactory state of
      matters could be imagined. And yet he felt that it would be impossible to
      take any steps with a view of bringing about a change.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had received several letters from Beatrice, and he had written several
      to her; but though in more than one he had told her in that plain strain
      which one adopts when one does not desire to be in any way convincing,
      that it was a most unfortunate day for her when she met him, still he did
      not suggest that their correspondence should cease.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was to be the end of their love?
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the constant attempt to answer this question that gave the stag his
      chance of life when, on the afternoon of the third day, Harold was
      commanded by his masters the gillies to fire into that thickening in the
      mist which he was given to understand by an unmistakable pantomime, was
      the stag.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the gillies were exchanging their remarks in Gaelic, flavouring them
      with very smoky whiskey, he was thinking, not of the escape of the stag,
      but of what possible end there could be to the love that existed between
      Beatrice and himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the renewed thinking upon this question that brought about the
      death of that particular stag and two others before the next evening, for
      he had arrived at a point when he felt that he must shoot either a stag or
      himself. He had arrived at a condition of despair that made pretty severe
      demands upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The slaughter of the stags saved him. When he saw their bodies stretched
      before him he felt exultant once more. He felt that he had overcome his
      fate; and it was the next morning before he realized the fact that he had
      done nothing of the sort&mdash;that the possibility of his ever being able
      to marry Beatrice Avon was as remote as it had been when he had fired
      blindly into the mist, and his masters, who had carried the guns,
      exhausted (he believed) the resources, of Gaelic sarcasm in comment.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVIII.&mdash;ON ENJOYING A RESPITE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T was the first
      week in October when Harold Wynne found himself in London. He had got a
      letter from Beatrice in which she told him that she and her father would
      return to London from Holland that week. Mr. Avon had conscientiously
      followed the track of an Irish informer in whom he was greatly interested,
      and who had, at the beginning of the century, found his way to Holland,
      where he was looked upon as a poor exile from Erin. He had betrayed about
      a dozen of his fellow-countrymen to their enemies, and had then returned
      to Ireland to live to an honoured old age on the proceeds of the bargain
      he had made for their heads.
    </p>
    <p>
      The result of Harold&rsquo;s consideration of the position that he occupied in
      regard to Beatrice, was this visit to London. He made up his mind that he
      should see her and tell her that, like Mrs. Browning&rsquo;s hero, he loved her
      so well that he only could leave her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could bring himself to do it, he felt. He believed that he was equal to
      an act of heroic self-sacrifice for the sake of the girl&mdash;that was
      how he put the matter to himself when being soaked on the Scotch mountain.
      Yes, he would go to her and tell her that the conclusion to which he had
      come was that they must forget one another&mdash;that only unhappiness
      could result from the relationship that existed between them. He knew that
      there is no more unsatisfactory relationship between a man and a woman
      than that which has love for a basis, but with no prospect of marriage;
      and he knew that so long as his father lived and continued selfish&mdash;and
      only death could divide him from his selfishness&mdash;marriage with
      Beatrice was out of the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was with this resolution upon him that he drove to the address in the
      neighbourhood of the British Museum, where Beatrice said she was to be
      found with her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was one of those mansions which at some period in the early part of the
      century had been almost splendid; now it was simply large. It was not the
      house that Harold would have cared to occupy, even rent free&mdash;and
      this was a consideration to him. But for a scholar who had a large library
      of his own, and who found it necessary to be frequently in the
      neighbourhood of the larger Library at the Museum, the house must
      undoubtedly have had its advantages.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was not at home. The elderly butler said that Mr. Avon had found it
      necessary to visit Brussels for a few days, and he had thus been delayed
      on the Continent beyond the date he had appointed for his return. He would
      probably be in England by the end of the week&mdash;the day was Wednesday.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harold left the gloom of Bloomsbury behind him, feeling a curious
      satisfaction at having failed to see Beatrice&mdash;the satisfaction of a
      respite. Some days must elapse before he could make known his resolution
      to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He strolled westward to a club of which he was a member&mdash;the Bedouin,
      and was about to order dinner, when someone came behind him and laid a
      hand, by no means gently, on his shoulder. Some of the Bedouins thought it
      <i>de rigueur</i> to play such pranks upon each other; and, to do them
      justice, it was only rarely that they dislocated a friend&rsquo;s shoulder or
      gave a nervous friend a fit. People said one never knew what was coming
      from the moment they entered the Bedouin Club, and the prominent Bedouins
      accepted this statement as embodying one of the most agreeable of its many
      distinctive features.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harold was always prepared for the worst in this place, so when the force
      of the blow swung him round and he saw an extremely plain arrangement of
      features, distorted by a smile of extraordinary breadth, beneath a
      closely-cropped crown of bright red hair, he merely said, &ldquo;Hallo, Archie,
      you here? I thought you were in South Africa lion-hunting or something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The smile that had previously distorted the features of the young man, was
      of such fulness that it might reasonably have been taken for granted that
      it could not be increased; the possessor showed, however, that that smile
      was not the result of a supreme effort. So soon as Harold had spoken he
      gave a wink, and that wink seemed to release the mechanical system by
      which his features were contorted, for in an instant his face became one
      mouth. In plain words, this mouth of the young man had swallowed up his
      other features. All that could be seen of his face was that enormous mouth
      flanked by a pair of enormous ears, like plantain leaves growing on each
      side of the crater of a volcano.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harold looked at him and laughed, then picked up a <i>menu</i> card and
      studied it until he calculated that the young man whom he had addressed as
      Archie should have thrown off so much of his smile as would enable him to
      speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave him plenty of time, and when he looked round he saw that some of
      the young man&rsquo;s features had succeeded in struggling to the surface, as it
      were, beneath the circular mat of red hair that lay between his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No South Africa for me, tarty chip,&rdquo; said Archie. (&ldquo;Tarty chip&rdquo; was the
      popular term of address that year among young men about town. Its
      philological significance was never discovered.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No South Africa for me; I went one better than that,&rdquo; continued the young
      man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I doubt it,&rdquo; said Harold. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had my eye on you until lately. You have
      usually gone one worse. Have you any money left&mdash;tell the truth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Money? I asked the tarty chips that look after that sort of thing for me
      how I stood the other day,&rdquo; said Archie, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m ashamed to say that I&rsquo;ve
      been spending less than my income&mdash;that is until a couple of months
      ago. I&rsquo;ve still about three million. What does that mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you&rsquo;ve got rid of about a million inside two years,&rdquo; said Harold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going it blind,&rdquo; said Archie. &ldquo;It only means that I&rsquo;ve spent fifty
      decimals in eighteen months. I can spare that, tarty chip.&rdquo; (It may
      possibly be remembered that in the slang of the year a decimal signified a
      thousand pounds.) &ldquo;That means that you&rsquo;ve squandered a fortune, Archie,&rdquo;
       said Harold, thinking what fifty thousand pounds would mean to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s not much of a squander in the deal when I got value for it,&rdquo; said
      Archie. &ldquo;I got plenty of value. I&rsquo;ve got to know all about this world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you&rsquo;ll soon get to know all about the next, if you go on at this
      rate,&rdquo; said Harold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not me; I&rsquo;ve got my money in sound places. You heard about my show.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your show? I&rsquo;ve heard about nothing for the past year but your shows.
      What&rsquo;s the latest? I want something to eat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, come with me to my private trough,&rdquo; cried the young man. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t lay
      down a mosaic pavement in your inside in this hole. Come along, tarty
      chip; I&rsquo;ve got a <i>chef</i> named Achille&mdash;he knows what suits us&mdash;also
      some &lsquo;84 Heidsieck. Come along with me, and I&rsquo;ll tell you all about the
      show. We&rsquo;ll go there together later on. We&rsquo;ll take supper with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! with her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure. You don&rsquo;t mean to say that you haven&rsquo;t heard that I&rsquo;ve taken
      the Legitimate Theatre for Mrs. Mowbray? Where on God&rsquo;s footstool have you
      been for the past month?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not further than the extreme North of Scotland. It was far enough. I saw
      a paragraph stating that Mrs. Mowbray, after being a failure in a number
      of places, had taken the Legitimate. What has that got to say to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not much, but I&rsquo;ve got a good deal to say to it. Oh, come along, and I&rsquo;ll
      tell you all about it. I&rsquo;m building a monument for myself. I&rsquo;ve got the
      Legitimate and I mean to make Irving and the rest of them sit up.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIX.&mdash;ON THE ADVANTAGES OF READY MONEY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>RCHIE BROWN was
      the only son of Mr. John Brown, the eminent contractor. Mr. John Brown had
      been a man of simple habits and no tastes. When a working navvy he had
      acquired a liking for oatmeal porridge, and up to the day of his death,
      when he had some twenty thousand persons in his employment, each of them
      earning money for him, he never rose above this comestible. He lived a
      thoroughly happy life, taking no thought about money, and having no idea,
      beyond the building of drinking fountains in his native town, how to spend
      the profits realized on his enormous transactions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, as the building of even the most complete system of drinking
      fountains, in a small town in Scotland, does not produce much impression
      upon the financial position of a man with some millions of pounds in cash,
      and making business profits to the extent of two hundred thousand a year,
      it was inevitable that, when a brick one afternoon fell on Mr. John
      Brown&rsquo;s head and fractured his skull so severely as to cause his death,
      his only son should be left very well provided for.
    </p>
    <p>
      Archie Brown was left provided with some millions in cash, and with
      property that yielded him about one hundred pounds a day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up to the day of his father&rsquo;s death he had never had more than five
      hundred a year to spend as pocket-money&mdash;he had saved even out of
      this modest sum, for he had scarcely any more expensive tastes than his
      father, though he had ever regarded <i>sole à la Normande</i> as more
      palatable than oatmeal porridge as a breakfast dish.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had never caused his father a moment&rsquo;s uneasiness; but as soon as he
      was given a bird&rsquo;s eye view, so to speak, of his income, he began to ask
      himself if there might not be something in the world more palatable even
      than <i>sole à la Normande</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of a year or two he had learned a good deal on the subject
      of what was palatable and what was not; for from the earliest records it
      is understood that the knowledge of good and the knowledge of evil may be
      found on the one tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      He began to be talked about, and that is always worth paying money for&mdash;some
      excellent judges say that it is the only thing worth paying money for.
      Occasionally he paid a trifle over the market price for this commodity.
      But then he knew that he generally paid more than the market price for
      everything that he bought, from his collars, which were unusually high,
      down to his boots, which were of glazed kid, so that he did not complain.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found that, after a while, the tradespeople, seeing that he paid them
      cash, treated him fairly, and that the person who supplied him with cigars
      was actually generous when he bought them by the thousand.
    </p>
    <p>
      People who at first had fancied that Mr. Archibald Brown was a plunger&mdash;that
      is, a swindler whom they could swindle out of his thousands&mdash;had
      reason to modify their views on the subject after some time. For six
      months he had been imposed upon in many directions. But with all the other
      things which had to be paid for, the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of
      Good and Evil should, he knew, be included. Imported in a fresh condition
      this was, he knew, expensive; but he had a sufficient acquaintance with
      the elements of fruit-culture to be well aware of the fact that in this
      condition it is worth very much more than the canned article.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bought his knowledge of good and evil fresh.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was no fool, some people said, exultantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      These were the people whose friends had tried to impose on him but had not
      succeeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was no fool, some people said regretfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      These were the people who had tried to impose on him but had not
      succeeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harold had always liked Archie Brown, and he had offered him much advice&mdash;vegetarian
      banquets of the canned fruit of the Tree of Knowledge. The shrewd
      outbursts of confidence in which Archie indulged now and again, showed
      Harold that he was fast coming to understand his position in society&mdash;his
      friends and his enemies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harold, after some further persuasion, got into the hansom which Archie
      had hailed, and was soon driving down Piccadilly to the spacious rooms of
      the latter&mdash;rooms furnished in a wonderful fashion. As a panorama of
      styles the sitting-room, which was about thirty feet square, with a
      greenhouse in the rear, would have been worth much to a lecturer on the
      progress or decadence of art&mdash;any average lecturer could make the
      furniture bear out his views, whether they took one direction or the
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two cabinets which had belonged to Louis XV were the finest specimens
      known in the world. They contained Sèvres porcelain and briar-root pipes.
      A third cabinet was in the purest style of boarding house art. A small
      gilt sofa was covered with old French tapestry which would have brought
      five pounds the square inch at an auction. Beside it was the famous
      Four-guinea Tottenham Armchair in best Utrecht velvet&mdash;three-nine-six
      in cretonne, carriage paid to any railway-station in the United Kingdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      A chair, the frame of which was wholly of ivory, carved in Italy, in the
      seventeenth century, by the greatest artist that ever lived, apparently
      had its uses in Archie Brown&rsquo;s <i>entourage</i>, for it sustained in an
      upright position a half-empty soda-water bottle&mdash;the bottle would not
      have stood upright but for the high relief in the carving of the flowing
      hair of the figure of Atalanta at one part of the frame. Near it was an
      interesting old oak chair that was for some time believed to have once
      belonged to King Henry VIII.
    </p>
    <p>
      In achieving this striking contrast to the carved ivory, Mr. Brown thought
      that he had proved his capacity to appreciate an important element in
      artistic arrangement. He pointed it out to Harold without delay. He had
      pointed it out to every other person who had visited his rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      He also pointed out a picture by one Rembrandt which he had picked up at
      an auction for forty shillings. A dealer had subsequently assured him that
      if he wanted a companion picture by the same painter he would not
      guarantee to procure it for him at a lower figure than twenty-five guineas&mdash;perhaps
      it might even cost him as high as thirty; therefore&mdash;the logic was
      Archie&rsquo;s&mdash;the Rembrandt had been a dead bargain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harold looked at this Burgomaster&rsquo;s Daughter in eighteenth century
      costume, and said that undoubtedly the painter knew what he was about.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so does Archie, tarty chip,&rdquo; said his host, leading him to one of the
      bedrooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now it&rsquo;s half past seven,&rdquo; said Archie, leaving him, &ldquo;and dinner will be
      served at a quarter to eight. I&rsquo;ve never been late but once, and Achille
      was so hurt that he gave me notice. I promised that it should never occur
      again, and it hasn&rsquo;t. He doesn&rsquo;t insist on my dressing for dinner, though
      he says he should like it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make my apologies to Achille,&rdquo; said Harold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that won&rsquo;t be necessary,&rdquo; said Archie seriously&mdash;&ldquo;at least I
      think it won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harold had never been in these rooms before&mdash;he wondered how it had
      chanced that he came to them at all. But before he had partaken of more
      than one of the <i>hors d&rsquo;ouvres</i>&mdash;there were four of them&mdash;he
      knew that he had done well to come. Achille was an artist, the Sauterne
      was Chateau Coutet of 1861, and the champagne was, as Archie had promised
      it should be, Heidsieck of 1884. The electric light was artfully toned
      down, and the middle-aged butler understood his business.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the family trough,&rdquo; said Archie. &ldquo;I say, Harry, isn&rsquo;t it one
      better than the oatmeal porridge of our dads&mdash;I mean of my dad;
      yours, I know, was always one of us; my dad wasn&rsquo;t, God bless him! If he
      had been we shouldn&rsquo;t be here now. He&rsquo;d have died a pauper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harold so far forgot himself as to say, &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t Carlyle remark somewhere
      that it&rsquo;s the fathers who work that the sons&mdash;ah, never mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Carlyle? What Carlyle was that? Do I know him?&rdquo; asked Archie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Harold, shaking his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t a tarty chip, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tart, not tarty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh. Don&rsquo;t neglect this jelly. It&rsquo;s the best thing that Achille does. It&rsquo;s
      the only thing that he ever repeats himself in. He came to me boasting
      that he could give me three hundred and sixty-five different dinners in
      the year. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s all very well,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;but what about Leap Year?&rsquo; I
      showed him there that his bluff wouldn&rsquo;t do. &lsquo;Pass&rsquo; said I, and he passed.
      But we understand one another now. I will say that he has never repeated
      himself except in this jelly. I make him give it to me once a week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; said Harold. &ldquo;It is something to think about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, while you&rsquo;re in front of it, but never after,&rdquo; said Archie. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
      what Achille says. &lsquo;The true dinner,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;is the one that makes you
      think while you&rsquo;re at it, but that never causes you a thought
      afterwards.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Achille is more than an artist, he is a philosopher,&rdquo; said Harold. &ldquo;What
      does he call this?&rdquo; he glanced at the menu card. &ldquo;&lsquo;<i>Glace à la chagrin
      d&rsquo;Achille</i>&rsquo; What does he mean by that? &lsquo;The chagrin of Achilles&rsquo;? Where
      does the chagrin come in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he has some story about a namesake of his,&rdquo; said Archie. &ldquo;He was cut
      up about something, and he wouldn&rsquo;t come out of the marquee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The tent,&rdquo; cried Harold. &ldquo;Achilles sulked in his tent. Of course, that&rsquo;s
      the &lsquo;<i>chagrin d&rsquo;Achille</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you heard of it too? Then the story has managed to leak out somehow.
      They always do. There&rsquo;s nothing in it. Now I&rsquo;ll tell you all about the
      show. Try one of these figs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harold helped himself to a green fig, the elderly butler placed a decanter
      of claret on the table, and disappeared with the noiselessness of a
      shadow.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXX.&mdash;ON THE LEGITIMATE IN ART.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HEN the history of
      the drama in England during the last twenty years of the nineteenth
      century comes to be written, the episode of the management of the
      Legitimate Theatre by Mrs. Mowbray will doubtless be amply treated from
      the standpoint of art, and the historian will, it may be confidently
      expected, lament the want of appreciation on the part of the public for
      the Shakespearian drama, to which the closing of the Legitimate Theatre
      was due.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were a considerable number of persons, however, who showed a
      readiness to assert that the management of the Legitimate by Mrs. Mowbray
      should be looked upon as a purely&mdash;only purely was not the word they
      used&mdash;social incident, having no basis whatever in art. It failed,
      they said, not because the people of England had ceased to love
      Shakespeare, but because Mr. Archie Brown had ceased to love Mrs. Mowbray.
    </p>
    <p>
      However this may be, there were also people who said that the Legitimate
      Theatre under the management of Mrs. Mowbray could not have been so great
      a financial failure, after all; for Mrs. Mowbray, when her season came to
      an end, wore as expensive dresses as ever, and drove as expensive horses
      as ever; and as everyone who had been associated with the enterprise had
      been paid&mdash;some people said overpaid&mdash;the natural assumption was
      that Shakespeare on the stage was not so abhorrent to the people of
      England as was generally supposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The people who took this view of the matter were people who had never
      heard the name of Mr. Archie Brown&mdash;people who regarded Mrs. Mowbray
      as a self-sacrificing lady who had so enthusiastic a desire to make the
      public acquainted with the beauties of Shakespeare, that she was quite
      content to spend her own fortune (wherever that came from) in producing
      &ldquo;Cymbeline&rdquo; and other masterpieces at the Legitimate.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were other people who said that Archie Brown was a young ass.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were others who said that Mrs. Mowbray was a harpy.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were others still&mdash;they were mostly men&mdash;who said that
      Mrs. Mowbray was the handsomest woman in England.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bitterest&mdash;they were mostly women&mdash;said that she was both
      handsome and a harpy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The truth regarding the difficult question of the Legitimate Theatre was
      gathered by Harold Wynne, as he swallowed his claret and ate his olives at
      the dining table at Archie Birown&rsquo;s rooms in Piccadilly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He perceived from what Archie told him, that Archie had a genuine
      enthusiasm in the cause of Shakespeare. How he had acquired it, he might
      have had considerable difficulty in explaining. He also gathered that Mrs.
      Mowbray cared very little for Shakespeare except as a medium for
      impressing upon the public the fact&mdash;she believed it to be a fact&mdash;that
      Mrs. Mowbray was the most beautiful woman in England.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cymbeline&rdquo; had, she considered, been written in the prophetic instinct,
      which the author so frequently manifested, that one day a woman with such
      shapely limbs as Mrs. Mowbray undoubtedly possessed, might desire to
      exhibit them to the public of this grand old England of Shakespeare&rsquo;s and
      ours.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Mowbray was probably the most expensive taste that any man in England
      could entertain.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this Harold gathered from the account of the theatrical enterprise, as
      communicated to him by Archie after dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the best of it all was, Archie assured him, that no human being could
      say a word against the character of Mrs. Mowbray.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never heard a word against the character of her frocks,&rdquo; said Harold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a big thing, the management of the Legitimate,&rdquo; said Archie,
      gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt; even when it&rsquo;s managed, shall we say, legitimately?&rdquo; said
      Harold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel the responsibility, I can tell you,&rdquo; said Archie. &ldquo;Shakespeare has
      never been given a proper chance in England; and although she&rsquo;s a year or
      two older than me, yet on the box seat of my coach she doesn&rsquo;t look a day
      over twenty-two&mdash;just when a woman is at her best, Harry. What I want
      to know is, shall it be said of us that Shakespeare&mdash;the immortal
      Shakespeare, mind you&mdash;Stratford upon Avon, you know&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe I have his late address,&rdquo; said Harold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right. But what I want to know is, shall it be said that we
      are willing to throw our Shakespeare overboard? In the scene in the front
      of the cave she is particularly fine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In an instant Harold&rsquo;s thoughts were carried back to a certain scene in
      front of a cave on a moonlight night; and for him the roar of life through
      Piccadilly was changed to the roar of the Atlantic. His thoughts remained
      far away while Archie talked gravely of building himself a monument by his
      revival of &ldquo;Cymbeline&rdquo;, with which the Legitimate had been opened by Mrs.
      Mowbray. Of course, the thing hadn&rsquo;t begun to pay yet, he explained.
      Everyone knew that the Bicycle had ruined theatrical business in London;
      but the Legitimate could fight even the Bicycle, and when the public had
      the beauty of Mrs. Mowbray properly impressed upon them, Shakespeare would
      certainly obtain that recognition which he deserves from England. Were
      Englishmen proud of Shakespeare, or were they not? that was what Archie
      wished very much to know. If the people of your so-called British Islands
      wish to throw Shakespeare overboard, just let them say so. But if they
      threw him over, the responsibility would rest with them; Mrs. Mowbray
      would still be the handsomest woman in England. At any rate, &ldquo;Cymbeline&rdquo;
       at the Legitimate would be a monument.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a lighthouse is a monument,&rdquo; said Harold, coming back from the Irish
      lough to Piccadilly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew you&rsquo;d agree with me,&rdquo; said Archie. &ldquo;You know that I&rsquo;ve always had
      a great respect for your opinion, Harry. I don&rsquo;t object so much as some
      tarty chips to your dad. I wish he&rsquo;d see Mrs. Mowbray. There&rsquo;s no vet.
      whose opinion I&rsquo;d sooner take on the subject than his. He&rsquo;d find her all
      right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harold looked at the young man whose plain features&mdash;visible when he
      did not smile too broadly&mdash;displayed the enthusiasm that possessed
      him when he was fancying that his devotion to the beauty of Mrs. Mowbray
      was a true devotion to Shakespeare. Archie Brown, he was well aware, was
      very imperfectly educated.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not, however, much worse than the general run of people. Like them
      he knew only enough of Shakespeare to be able to misquote him now and
      again; and, like them, he believed that. Darwinism meant nothing more than
      that men had once been monkeys.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harold looked at Archie, and felt that Mrs. Mowbray was a fortunate woman
      in having met with him. The monument was being raised, Harold felt; and he
      was right. The management of the Legitimate-Theatre was a memorial to
      Vanity working heart, and soul with Ignorance to the praise and glory of
      Shakespeare.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span> EFORE Archie had
      completed his confidences, a visitor was announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s only old Playdell,&rdquo; said Archie. &ldquo;You know old Playdell, of
      course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so certain that I do,&rdquo; said Harold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s a good old soul who was kicked out of the Church by the bishop
      for doing something or other. He&rsquo;s useful to me&mdash;keeps my
      correspondence in order&mdash;spots the chaps that write the begging
      letters, and sees that they don&rsquo;t get anything out of me, while he takes
      care that all the genuine ones get all that they deserve. He&rsquo;s an Oxford
      man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Playdell&mdash;Playdell,&rdquo; said Harold. &ldquo;Surely he can&rsquo;t be the fellow
      that got run out for marrying people without a licence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s his speciality,&rdquo; said Archie. &ldquo;Come along, chippie Chaplain. Chip
      in, and have a glass of something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A middle-aged man, wearing the coat and the tie of a cleric, entered the
      room with a smile and a bow to Harold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve heard of Mr. Wynne, Play?&rdquo; said Archie. &ldquo;The Honourable Harold
      Wynne. He&rsquo;s heard of you&mdash;yes, you bet your hoofs on that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say you&rsquo;ve heard of me, Mr. Wynne,&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the black
      sheep in a flock that obtain notoriety; the colourless ones escape notice.
      I&rsquo;m a black sheep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re about as black as they make them, old Play,&rdquo; remarked Archie, with
      a prompt and kindly acquiescence. &ldquo;But your blackness doesn&rsquo;t go deeper
      than the wool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say that because you are always disposed to be charitable, Archie,&rdquo;
       said Mr. Playdell. &ldquo;Even with you I&rsquo;m afraid that another notorious
      character is not so black as he&rsquo;s painted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither he is,&rdquo; said Archie. &ldquo;You know as well as I do that the devil is
      not so black as he used to be&mdash;he&rsquo;s turning gray in his old age.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They treated me worse than they treated the Fiend himself, Mr. Wynne,&rdquo;
       said Playdell. &ldquo;They turned me out of the Church, but the Church still
      retains the Prince of Darkness. He is still the most powerful auxiliary
      that the Church knows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you expressed that sentiment when in orders,&rdquo; said Harold, &ldquo;I can
      quite easily understand how you find yourself outside the Church.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was quite orthodox when in the Church, Mr. Wynne. I couldn&rsquo;t afford to
      be otherwise,&rdquo; said Playdell. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t even an Honest Doubter. I felt
      that if I had begun to doubt I might become a Dissenter before I knew what
      I was about. It is only since I left the Church that I&rsquo;ve indulged in the
      luxury of being unorthodox.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take a glass of wine for your stomach&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; said Archie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That lad is the son of a Scotch Nonconformist,&rdquo; said Mr. Playdell to
      Harold; &ldquo;hence the text. Would it be unorthodox to say that an inscrutable
      Providence did not see fit to preserve the reply of Timothy to that
      advice? For my own part I cannot doubt for a moment that Timothy inquired
      for what other reason his correspondent fancied he might take the wine. I
      like my young patron&rsquo;s La Rose. It must have been something very different
      from this that the person alluded to when he said &lsquo;my love is better than
      wine.&rsquo; Yes, I&rsquo;ve always thought that the truth of the statement was
      largely dependent on the wine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take my oath that isn&rsquo;t orthodox,&rdquo; said Archie. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better mind
      what you&rsquo;re about, chippie Chaplain, or I&rsquo;ll treat you as the bishop did.
      This is an orthodox household, let me tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel like Balaam&rsquo;s ass sometimes, Mr. Wynne, in this situation,&rdquo; said
      Mr. Playdell. &ldquo;In endeavouring to avoid the angel with the sword on one
      hand&mdash;that is the threatening orthodoxy of the Church&mdash;I make
      myself liable to a blow from the staff of the prophet&mdash;our young
      friend is the prophet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will say this for you, chippie Chaplain,&rdquo; said Archie, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve kept me
      straight. Not that I ever did take kindly to the flowing bowl; but we all
      know what temptations there are.&rdquo; He looked into his glass and spoke
      solemnly, shaking his head. &ldquo;Yes, Harry, I&rsquo;ve never drunk a thimbleful
      more than I should since old Play here lectured me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I could only persuade you&mdash;&lsquo;&rsquo;commenced Mr. Playdell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not such an ass,&rdquo; cried Archie, interrupting him. Then he turned
      to Harold, saying, &ldquo;The chippie Chaplain wants to marry me to some one
      whose name we never mention. That has always been his weakness&mdash;marrying
      tarty chips that he had no right to marry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t mistake, Mr. Playdell, it was this little weakness that
      brought you to grief,&rdquo; said Harold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was the only point that the bishop could lay hold of, Mr. Wynne,&rdquo; said
      Playdell. &ldquo;I held, and I still hold, that the ceremony of marriage may be
      performed by any person who has been ordained&mdash;that the question of a
      licence is not one that should come forward upon any occasion. Those who
      hold other opinions are those who would degrade the ordinance into a mere
      civil act.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you married without question every couple who came to you, I
      believe?&rdquo; said Harold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did, Mr. Wynne. And I will be happy to marry any other couples who come
      to me for that purpose now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, you are no longer in the Church, and such marriages would be no
      marriages in the eyes of the law.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing can be more certain, Mr. Wynne. But I know that there are many
      persons in this country who hold, with me, that the ordinance is not one
      that should be made the subject of a licence bought from a bishop&mdash;who
      hold that the very act of purchase is a gross degradation of the ordinance
      of God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, chippie Chaplain, haven&rsquo;t we had enough of that?&rdquo; said Archie.
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve pegged away at that marriage business with me for a good many
      months. Now, I say, pass the marriage business. Let us have a fresh deal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Wynne, I merely wished to explain my position to you,&rdquo; said Playdell.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m on the side of the angels in this question, as a great statesman but
      a poor scientist said of another question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pass the statesman as well,&rdquo; cried Archie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do tarty chips like us care for politics or other fads? He told me
      the other day, Harry, that instead of introducing a bill for the admission
      of ladies as members of Parliament, it would soon be necessary to
      introduce a bill for the admission of gentlemen as members&mdash;yes, you
      said that. You can&rsquo;t deny it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Mr. Playdell. &ldquo;The result of the last General Election&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pass the General Election,&rdquo; shouted Archie. &ldquo;Mr. Wynne hates that sort of
      thing. Now give an account of yourself. What have you done to earn your
      screw since morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is what I have come to, Mr. Wynne,&rdquo; said Playdell. &ldquo;Think of it; a
      clergyman and M.A. Oxon, forced to give an account of his stewardship to a
      young cub like that!&rdquo; He laughed after a moment of seriousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem to feel deeply the degradation,&rdquo; remarked Harold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing to the depths to which I have fallen,&rdquo; said Mr. Playdell. &ldquo;I
      was never more than a curate, but in spite of the drawback of being
      privileged to preach the Gospel twice a week, the curacy was a comfortable
      one. I published two volumes of my sermons, Mr. Wynne. They sold poorly in
      England, but I believe that in America they made the fortune of the
      publishers that pirated them. It is perfectly well known that my sermons
      achieved a great and good purpose in the States. They were practical. I
      will say that for them. The leader of the corner in hogs who ran the
      prices up last autumn, sold out of the business, I understand, after
      reading my sermon on the text, &lsquo;The husks that the swine do eat.&rsquo; Several
      judges also resigned, admitting that they were converted. It was freely
      stated that even a Congressman had been reformed by one sermon of mine,
      while another was known to have brought tears to the eyes of a reporter on
      the <i>New York Herald</i>. And yet, with all these gratifying results, I
      never got a penny out of the American edition. Just think what would
      happen on this side of the Atlantic if, let us say, a Royal Academician
      were to find grace through a sermon, or&mdash;to assume an extreme case&mdash;a
      member of the Stock Exchange? Why, the writer would be a made man. I had
      thoughts of going to America, Mr. Wynne. At any rate, I&rsquo;m going to deal
      with the publishers there directly. A firm in Boston is at present about
      to boom a Bowdlerized edition of the Bible which I have prepared for
      family reading in the States&mdash;not a word in it that the purest-minded
      young woman in all Boston might not see. It should sell, Mr. Wynne. I&rsquo;m
      also translating into English a volume of American humour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you a chance of going to America, before you sleep if you don&rsquo;t
      dry up about your sermons and suchlike skittles,&rdquo; said Archie. &ldquo;The
      decanter&rsquo;s beside you. Fill your glass. Mr. Wynne is coming to my show
      to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Playdell passed the decanter without filling his glass. &ldquo;You know that
      I never take more than one glass of La Rose,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I have found out
      all about your house painter who fell off the ladder and broke all his
      ribs&mdash;he is the same as your Clergyman&rsquo;s Orphan, and he lives in the
      same house as your Widow of a Naval Officer whose little all was invested
      in a fraudulent building society&mdash;he is also &lsquo;First Thessalonians
      seven and ten. P.O.O. or stamps&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great Godfrey!&rdquo; cried Archie; &ldquo;and I had already written out a cheque for
      twenty pounds to send to that swindler! Do you mean to tell me, Play, that
      all those you&rsquo;ve mentioned are impostors?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All? Why, there&rsquo;s only one impostor among the lot,&rdquo; said Mr. Playdell.
      &ldquo;He is &lsquo;First Thessalonians,&rsquo; and he has at least a dozen branch
      establishments.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s enough to make a tarty chip disgusted with God&rsquo;s footstool,&rdquo; said
      Archie. &ldquo;Before old Play took me in hand I used to fling decimals about
      right and left, without inquiry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was the sole support of several of the most notorious swindlers in the
      country,&rdquo; said Mr. Playdell. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve managed to whittle them down
      considerably. Shakespeare is at present the only impostor that has defied
      my efforts,&rdquo; he added, in a whisper to Harold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harold laughed. He was beginning to feel some remorse at having previously
      looked on Archie Brown as a good-natured fool. He now felt that, in spite
      of Mrs. Mowbray, he would not wreck his life.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXII.&mdash;ON SHAKESPEARE AND SUPPER.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">C</span>ARRIAGES by the
      score were waiting at the fine Corinthian entrance to the Legitimate, when
      Harold and Archie reached the theatre in their hansom. The <i>façade</i>
      of the Legitimate Theatre is so severely Corinthian that foreign visitors
      invariably ask what church it is.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was probably the classical columns supporting the pediment of the
      entrance that caused Archie to abate his frivolous conversation with his
      friend in the hansom&mdash;Archie had been expressing the opinion that it
      was exhilarating&mdash;only exhilarating was not the word he used&mdash;to
      swear at a man who had once been a clergyman and who still wore the dress
      of a cleric. &ldquo;A chap feels that his turn has come,&rdquo; he had said. &ldquo;No
      matter how wrong they are you can&rsquo;t swear at them and tell them to come
      down out of that, when they&rsquo;re in their own pulpits&mdash;they&rsquo;d have you
      up for brawling. That&rsquo;s why I like to take it out of old Playdell. He
      tells me, however, that there&rsquo;s no dean in the Church that gathers in the
      decimals as he does in my shop. But, bless you! he saves me his screw
      three times over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But now that the classical front of the Legitimate came in view, Archie
      became solemn.
    </p>
    <p>
      He possibly appreciated the feelings of a conscientious clergyman when
      about to enter his Church.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shakespeare was a great responsibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      So was Mrs. Mowbray.
    </p>
    <p>
      The performance was not quite over; but before Archie had paid the
      hansomeer, the audience was streaming out from every door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stand here and listen to what the people are saying.&rdquo; whispered Archie.
      &ldquo;I often do it. It is only in this way that you can learn how much
      appreciation for Shakespeare still remains in England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took up his position with Harold at the foot of the splendid staircase
      of the theatre, where the people chatted together while waiting for their
      carriages.
    </p>
    <p>
      With scarcely an exception, the remarks had a hearing upon the performance
      of &ldquo;Cymbeline.&rdquo; Only two ladies confined their criticisms to their
      respective medical advisers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the others, one man said that Mrs. Mowbray bore a striking resemblance
      to her photographs.
    </p>
    <p>
      A second said that she was the most beautiful woman in England.
    </p>
    <p>
      A third said that she knocked sparks out of Polly Floss in the same line
      of business. (Polly Floss was the leading exponent of burlesque).
    </p>
    <p>
      One woman said that Mrs. Mowbray was most picturesquely dressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      A second said that she was most picturesquely undressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      A third wondered if Liberty had got the exact tint of the robe that Mrs.
      Mowbray had worn in the second act.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet some people say that there&rsquo;s no appreciation of Shakespeare in
      England!&rdquo; said Archie, as he led Harold round the stalls, over which the
      attendants were spreading covers, and on to Mrs. Mowbray&rsquo;s private rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From the crowds that went out by every door, I judge that the theatre is
      making money, at any rate; and I suppose that&rsquo;s the most practical test of
      appreciation,&rdquo; said Harold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, they don&rsquo;t all pay,&rdquo; said Archie. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a feature of theatrical
      management that it takes an outsider some time to understand. Mrs. Mowbray
      should understand it pretty well by this time, so should her business
      manager. I&rsquo;m just getting to understand it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean to say that the people are allowed to come in without paying?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It amounts to that in the long run&mdash;literally the long run&mdash;of
      the piece, I believe. Upon my soul, there are some people who fancy that a
      chap runs a show as a sort of free entertainment for the public. The
      dramatic critics seem to fancy that a chap produces a play, simply in
      order to give them an opportunity of showing off their own cleverness in
      slating it. It seems that a writer-chap can&rsquo;t show his cleverness in
      praising a piece, but only in slanging it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that I&rsquo;d try and make people pay for their seats.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I used always to pay for mine in the old days&mdash;but then, I was
      always squandering my money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have always paid for mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The manager says that if you asked people to pay, they&rsquo;d be mortally
      offended and never enter the theatre again, and where would you be then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where, indeed?&rdquo; said Harold. &ldquo;I expect your manager must know his
      business thoroughly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He does. It requires tact to get people to come to see Shakespeare,&rdquo; said
      Archie. &ldquo;But a chap can&rsquo;t build a monument for himself without paying for
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be ridiculous to expect it,&rdquo; said Harold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pushing aside a magnificent piece of heavy drapery, Archie brought his
      friend into a passage illuminated by the electric light; and knocking at a
      door at the farther end, he was admitted by Mrs. Mowbray&rsquo;s maid, into a
      prettily-furnished sitting-room and into the presence of Mrs. Mowbray, who
      was sitting robed in something very exquisite and cloud-like&mdash;not
      exactly a peignoir but something that suggested a peignoir.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was like a picture by Romney. If one could imagine all the charm of
      all the pictures of Emma Hamilton (<i>née</i> Lyon) which Romney painted,
      meeting harmoniously in another creature, one would come within reasonable
      distance of seeing Mrs. Mowbray, as Harold saw her when he entered the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even with the disadvantage of the exaggerated colour and the
      over-emphasized eye-lashes necessary for the searching illumination of the
      footlights, she was very lovely, Harold acknowledged.
    </p>
    <p>
      But all the loveliness of Mrs. Mowbray produced but a trifling effect
      compared to that produced by her charm of manner. She was the most natural
      woman ever known.
    </p>
    <p>
      The position of the natural man has been defined by an eminent authority.
      But who shall define the position of the natural woman?
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Mrs. Mowbray&rsquo;s perfect simplicity, especially when talking to men&mdash;as
      a matter of fact she preferred talking to men rather than to women&mdash;that
      made her seem so lovely&mdash;nay, that made a man feel that it was good
      for him to be in her presence. She was devoid of the smallest trace of
      affectation. She seemed the embodiment of truth. She never smiled for the
      sake of conventionality. But when she did smile, just as Harold entered
      the room, her head turning round so that her face was looking over her
      shoulder, she had all the spiritual beauty of the loveliest picture ever
      painted by Greuze, consequently the loveliest picture ever painted by the
      hand of man.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet she was so very human.
    </p>
    <p>
      An Algy and an Eddy were already in the room&mdash;the first was a
      Marquis, the second was the eldest son of a duke. Both were handsome lads,
      of quiet manners, and both were in the Household Cavalry. Mrs. Mowbray
      liked to be surrounded by the youngest of men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harold had been acquainted with her long before she had become an actress.
      He had not had an opportunity of meeting her since; but he found that she
      remembered him very well.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had heard of his father, she said, looking at him in a way that did
      not in the least suggest a picture by Greuze.
    </p>
    <p>
      When people referred to his father they did not usually assume a look of
      innocence. Most of them would have had difficulty in assuming such a look
      under any circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father is frequently heard of,&rdquo; said Harold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your father&rsquo;s son also,&rdquo; said Mrs. Mowbray. &ldquo;What a freak of Lady
      Innisfail&rsquo;s! She lured you all across to Ireland. I heard so much. And
      what came of it, after all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Acute admiration for the allurements of Lady Innisfail in my case, and a
      touch of acute rheumatism in my father&rsquo;s case,&rdquo; said Harold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither will be fatal to the sufferers,&rdquo; said Mrs. Mowbray&mdash;&ldquo;or to
      Lady Innisfail, for that matter,&rdquo; she added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say not,&rdquo; remarked Algy. &ldquo;We all admire Lady Innisfail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Few cases of acute admiration of Lady Innisfail have proved fatal, so far
      as I can hear, Lord Brackenthorpe,&rdquo; said Mrs. Mowbray. &ldquo;Young mem have
      suffered from it and have become exemplary husbands and parents.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if they don&rsquo;t live happy, that we may,&rdquo; said Archie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the end of the whole matter,&rdquo; said. Harold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the end of the orthodox fairy tale,&rdquo; said Mrs. Mowbray. &ldquo;Was your
      visit to Ireland a fairy story, Mr. Wynne?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harold wondered how much this woman knew of the details of his visit to
      Ireland. Before he-could think of an answer in the same strain, Mrs.
      Mowbray had risen from the little gilt sofa, and had taken a step or two
      toward her dressing-room. The look she tossed to Harold, when she turned
      round with her fingers on the handle of the door, was a marvellous one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had it been attempted by any other woman, it would have provoked derision
      on the part of the average man&mdash;certainly on the part of Harold
      Wynne. But, coming from Mrs. Mowbray, it conveyed&mdash;well, all that she
      meant it to convey. It was not merely fascinating, it was fascination
      itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was such a look as this, he felt&mdash;but nearly a year had passed
      before he had thought of the parallel&mdash;that Venus had cast at Paris
      upon a momentous occasion. It was the glance of Venus Victrix. It made a
      man think&mdash;a year or so afterwards&mdash;of Ahola and Aholibah, of
      Ashtoreth, of Cleopatra, of Faustina, of Iseult, of Rosamond.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet the momentary expression of her features was as simple and as
      natural as that worn by one of Greuze&rsquo;s girls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll not be more than ten minutes,&rdquo; said
    </p>
    <p>
      Archie. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how she manages to dress herself in the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not exaggerate. Mrs. Mowbray returned in ten minutes, with no trace
      of paint upon her face, wearing a robe that seemed to surround her with
      fleecy clouds. The garment was not much more than an atmosphere&mdash;it
      was a good deal less substantial than the atmosphere of London in December
      or that of Sheffield in June.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall have the pleasantest of suppers,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and the pleasantest
      of chats. I understand that Mr. Wynne has solved the Irish problem.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what is the solution, Mrs. Mowbray?&rdquo; said Lord Brackenthorpe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The solution&mdash;ah&mdash;&lsquo;a gray eye or so&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Mrs. Mowbray.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little Mercutio swagger with which she gave point to the words, was
      better than anything she had done on the stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, Mr. Wynne, you must lead the way with me to our little
      supper-room,&rdquo; said she, before the laugh, in which everyone joined, at the
      pretty bit of comedy, had ceased.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harold gave her his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      When at the point of entering the room&mdash;it was daintily furnished
      with old English oak and old English silver&mdash;Mrs. Mowbray said, in
      the most casual way possible, &ldquo;I hope you will tell me all that may be
      told about that charming White Lady of the Cave. How amusing it must have
      been to watch the chagrin of Lord Fotheringay, when Mr. Airey gave him to
      understand that he meant to make love to that young person with the
      wonderful eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was intensely amusing, indeed,&rdquo; said Harold, who had become prepared
      for anything that Mrs. Mowbray might say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you must have been amused; for, of course, you knew that Mr. Airey
      was not in earnest&mdash;that he had simply been told off by Miss Craven
      to amuse himself with the young person, in order to induce her to take her
      beautiful eyes off&mdash;off&mdash;someone else, and to turn them
      admiringly upon Mr. Airey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was the most amusing part of the comedy, of course,&rdquo; said Harold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What fools some girls are!&rdquo; laughed Mrs. Mowbray. It was well known that
      she disliked the society of women.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a wise provision of nature that the fools should be the girls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I have known a fool or two among men,&rdquo; said Mrs. Mowbray, with
      another laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have known&mdash;did you say <i>have known?</i>&rdquo; said Harold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any girl who has lived in this world of ours for a quarter of a century,
      should have seen enough to make her aware of the fact that the best way to
      set about increasing the passion of, let us say, the average man&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, the average man is passionless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the passion of whatever man you please&mdash;for a young woman whom
      he loves, or fancies he loves&mdash;it&rsquo;s all the same in the end&mdash;is
      to induce him to believe that several other men are also in love with
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is one of the rudiments of a science of which you are the leading
      exponent,&rdquo; said Harold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet Miss Craven was foolish enough to fancy that the man of whom she
      was thinking, would give himself up to think of her so soon as he believed
      that Mr. Airey was in love with her rival! Ah, here are our lentils and
      pulse. How good it is of you to imperil your digestions by taking supper
      with me, when only a few hours can have passed since you dined.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Digestion is not an immortal soul,&rdquo; said Harold, &ldquo;and I believe that
      immortal souls have been imperilled before now, for the sake of taking
      supper with the most beautiful woman in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you ever heard a woman say that I am beautiful?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never,&rdquo; said Harold. &ldquo;That is the one sin which a woman never pardons in
      another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not know women&mdash;&rdquo; with a little pitying smile. &ldquo;A woman will
      forgive a woman for being more beautiful than herself&mdash;for being less
      virtuous than herself, but never for being better-dressed than herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For how many of the three sins do you ask forgiveness of woman&mdash;two
      or three?&rdquo; said Harold, gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      But instead of making an answer, Mrs. Mowbray said something about the
      necessity of cherishing a digestion. It was disgraceful, she said, that
      bread-and-butter and arithmetic should be forced upon a school boy&mdash;that
      such magnificent powers of digestion as he possessed should not be
      utilized ta the uttermost.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Brackenthorpe said he knew a clever artist chap, who had drawn a
      sketch of about a thousand people crowding over one another, in an
      American hotel, in order to see a boy, who had been overheard asking his
      mother what was the meaning of the word dyspepsia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Mowbray wondered if the melancholy of Hamlet was due to a weak
      digestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harold said he thought it should rather be accepted as evidence that there
      was a Schleswig-Holstein question even in Hamlet&rsquo;s day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime, the pheasants and sparkling red Burgundy were affording
      compensation for the absence of any brilliant talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the young men lit their cigarettes. Mrs. Mowbray had never been known
      to risk her reputation (for femininity) by letting a cigarette between her
      lips; but her femininity was in no way jeopardized&mdash;rather was it
      accentuated&mdash;by her liking to be in the neighbourhood of where
      cigarettes were being smoked&mdash;that is, when the cigarettes were good
      and when the smokers were pleasant young men with titles, or even
      unpleasant young men with thousands.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the lapse of an hour, a message came regarding Mrs. Mowbray&rsquo;s
      brougham. Her guests rose and she looked about for her wrap.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Harold Wynne was laying it on her lovely shoulders, she kept her
      eyes fixed upon his. Hers were full of intelligence. When he had carefully
      fastened the gold clasp just beneath the hollow of her throat&mdash;it
      required very careful handling&mdash;she poised her head to the extent of
      perhaps a quarter of an inch to one side, and laughed; then she moved away
      from him, but turned her head so that her face was once more over her
      shoulder, like the face of the Greuze girl from whom she had learnt the
      trick.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew that she wanted him to ask her from whom she had heard the stories
      regarding Castle Innisfail and its guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      He also knew that the reason she wanted him to ask her this question, was
      in order that she might have the delight of refusing to answer him, while
      keeping him in the expectancy of receiving an answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such a delight would, of course, be a malicious one. But he knew that it
      would be a thoroughly womanly one, and he knew that Mrs. Mowbray was a
      thorough woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore he laughed back at her and did not ask her anything&mdash;not
      even to take his arm out to her brougham.
    </p>
    <p>
      Archie Brown did, and she took his arm, still looking over her shoulder at
      Harold.
    </p>
    <p>
      It only needed that the lovely, wicked look should vanish in a sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it did.
    </p>
    <p>
      The full lips parted, and the poise of the head was increased by perhaps
      the eighth part of an inch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;A gray eye or so,&rsquo;&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her laughter rang down the corridor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the best of it all is, that no one can say a word against her
      character,&rdquo; said Archie.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the conclusion of his rhapsody in the hansom, in which he and
      Harold were driving down Piccadilly&mdash;a rhapsody upon the beauty, the
      genius, and the expensiveness of Mrs. Mowbray.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harold was silent. The truth was that he was thinking about something far
      apart from Mrs. Mowbray, her beauty, her doubtful genius, and her
      undoubted power of spending money.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you say?&rdquo; said Archie. &ldquo;Great Godfrey! you don&rsquo;t mean to say that
      you&rsquo;ve heard a word breathed against her character?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary,&rdquo; said Harold, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always heard it asserted that Mrs.
      Mowbray is the best dressed woman in London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me your hand, old chap; I knew that I could trust you to do her
      justice,&rdquo; cried Archie.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIII.&mdash;ON BLESSING OR DOOM.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">E</span>VEN before he
      slept, Harold Wynne found that he had a good many matters to think about,
      in addition to the exquisitely natural poises of Mrs. Mowbray&rsquo;s shapely
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was apparent to him that Mrs. Mowbray had somehow obtained a
      circumstantial account of the appearance of Beatrice Avon at the Irish
      Castle, and of the effect that had been produced, in more than one
      direction, by her appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the most important information that he had derived from Mrs. Mowbray
      was that which had reference to the attitude of Edmund Airey toward
      Beatrice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Undoubtedly, Mrs. Mowbray had, by some means, come to be possessed of the
      truth regarding the apparent fascination which Beatrice had for Edmund
      Airey. It was a trick&mdash;it was the result of a conspiracy between
      Helen Craven and Edmund, in order that he, Harold, should be prevented
      from even telling Beatrice that he loved her. Helen had felt certain that
      Beatrice, when she fancied&mdash;poor girl!&mdash;that she had produced so
      extraordinary an impression upon the wealthy and distinguished man, would
      be likely to treat the poor and undistinguished man, whose name was Harold
      Wynne, in such a way as would prevent him from ever telling her that he
      loved her!
    </p>
    <p>
      And Edmund had not hesitated to play the part which Helen had assigned to
      him! For more than a moment did Harold feel that his friend had behaved in
      a grossly dishonourable way. But he knew that his friend, if taxed with
      behaving dishonourably, would be ready to prove&mdash;if he thought it
      necessary&mdash;that, so far from acting dishonourably, he had shown
      himself to be Harold&rsquo;s best friend, by doing his best to prevent Harold
      from asking a penniless girl to be his wife. Oh, yes, Mr. Edmund Airey
      would have no trouble in showing, to the satisfaction of a considerable
      number of people&mdash;perhaps, even to his own satisfaction&mdash;that he
      was acting the part of a truly conscientious; and, perhaps, a
      self-sacrificing friend, by adopting Helen Craven&rsquo;s suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harold felt very bitter toward his friend Edmund Airey; though it was
      unreasonable for him to do so; for had not he come to precisely the same
      conclusion as his friend in respect of Beatrice, this conclusion being, of
      course, that nothing but unhappiness could be the result of his loving
      Beatrice, and of his asking Beatrice to love him?
    </p>
    <p>
      If Edmund Airey had succeeded in preventing him from carrying out his
      designs, Harold would be saved from the necessity of having with Beatrice
      that melancholy interview to which he was looking forward; therefore it
      was unreasonable for him to entertain any feeling of bitterness toward
      Edmund.
    </p>
    <p>
      But for all that, he felt very bitterly toward Edmund&mdash;a fact which
      shows that, in some men as well as in all women, logic is subordinate to
      feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was also far from logical on his part to begin to think, only after he
      had accused his friend of dishonourable conduct, of the source whence the
      evidence upon which he had founded his accusation, was derived.
    </p>
    <p>
      How had Mrs. Mowbray come to hear how Edmund Airey had plotted with Helen
      Craven, he asked himself. He began to wonder how she could have heard
      about the gray eyes of Beatrice, to which she had alluded more than once,
      with such excellent effect from the standpoint of art. From whom could she
      have heard so much?
    </p>
    <p>
      She certainly did not hear it from Mr. Durdan, even if she was acquainted
      with him, which was doubtful; for Mr. Durdan was discreet. Besides, Mr.
      Durdan was rarely eloquent on any social subject. He was the sort of man
      who makes a tour on the Continent and returns to tell you of nothing
      except a flea at Bellaggio.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was it possible that some of the fishing men had been taking notes unknown
      to any of their fellow guests, for the benefit of Mrs. Mowbray?
    </p>
    <p>
      Harold did not think so.
    </p>
    <p>
      After some time he ceased to trouble himself with these vain speculations.
      The fact&mdash;he believed it to be a fact&mdash;remained the same:
      someone who had been at Castle Innisfail had given Mrs. Mowbray a highly
      circumstantial account of certain occurrences in the neighbourhood of the
      Castle; and if Mrs. Mowbray had received such an account, why might not
      anyone else be equally favoured?
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus it was that he strayed into new regions of speculation, where he
      could not possibly find any profit. What did it matter to him if everyone
      in London knew that Edmund Airey had plotted with Helen Craven, to prevent
      an impecunious man from marrying a penniless girl? All that remained for
      him to do was to go to the girl, and tell her that he had made a mistake&mdash;that
      he would be asking her to make too great a sacrifice, were he to hold her
      to her promise to love him and him only.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was somewhat curious that his resolution in this matter should be
      strengthened by the fact of his having learned that Edmund Airey had not
      been in earnest, in what was generally regarded at Castle Innisfail as an
      attitude of serious, and not merely autumn, love-making, in respect of
      Beatrice.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not feel at all annoyed to learn that, if he were to withdraw from
      the side of Beatrice, his place would not be taken by that wealthy and
      distinguished man, Edmund Airey. When he had at first made up his mind to
      go to Beatrice and ask her to forget that he had ever told her that he
      loved her, he had had an uneasy feeling that his friend might show even a
      greater interest than he had done on the evening of the <i>tableaux</i> at
      the Castle, in the future movements of Beatrice.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that time his resolution had not been overwhelming in its force. But
      now that Mrs. Mowbray had made that strange communication&mdash;it almost
      amounted to a revelation&mdash;to him, he felt almost impatient at the
      delay that he knew there must be before he could see the girl and make his
      confession to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had two more days to think over his resolution, in addition to his
      sleepless night after receiving Mrs. Mowbray&rsquo;s confidences; and the result
      of keeping his thoughts in the one direction was, that at last he had
      almost convinced himself that he was glad that the opportunity had arrived
      for him to present himself to the girl, in order to tell her that he would
      no longer stand in the way of her loving someone else.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he found himself in her presence, however, his convictions on this
      particular point were scarcely so strong as they might have been.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was sitting in front of the fire in the great drawing-room that
      retained all the original decorations of the Brothers Adam, and she was
      wearing something beautifully simple&mdash;something creamy, with old
      lace. The furniture of the room also belonged to the period of the Adams,
      and on the walls were a number of coloured engravings by Bartolozzi after
      Cipriani and Angelica Kauffmann.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was in his arms in a moment. She gave herself to him as naturally and
      as artlessly as though she were a child; and he held her close to him,
      looking down upon her face without uttering a word&mdash;kissing her mouth
      conscientiously, her shell-pink cheeks earnestly, her forehead
      scrupulously, and her chin playfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was how he opened the interview which he had arranged to part them
      for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they both drew a long breath simultaneously, and both laughed in
      unison.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he held her away from him for a few seconds, looking upon her
      exquisite face. Again he kissed her&mdash;but this time solemnly and with
      something of the father about the action.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At last&mdash;at last,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At last,&rdquo; she murmured in reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me that I have never seen you before,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;You seem to
      be a different person altogether. I do not remember anything of your face,
      except your eyes&mdash;no, by heavens! your eyes are different also.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was dark as midnight in the depths of that seal-cave,&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean that&mdash;ah, yes, my beloved! If I could have seen your eyes
      at that moment I know I should have found them full of the light that I
      now see in their depths. You remember what I said to you on the morning
      after your arrival at the Castle? Your eyes meant everything to me then&mdash;I
      knew it&mdash;beatitude or doom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you know now what they meant?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her earnestly and passionately for some moments. Then his
      hands dropped suddenly as though they were the hands of a man who had died
      in a moment&mdash;his hands dropped, he turned away his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God knows, God knows,&rdquo; he said, with what seemed like a moan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;God knows, and you know as well as God that in my heart
      there is nothing that does not mean love for you. Does love mean blessing
      or doom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God knows,&rdquo; said he again. &ldquo;Your love should mean to me the most blessed
      thing on earth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your love makes me most blessed among women,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      This exchange of thought could scarcely be said to make easier the task
      which he had set himself to do before nightfall.
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed to become aware of this, for he went to the high mantelpiece,
      and stood with his hands upon it, earnestly examining the carved marble
      frieze, cream-tinted with age, which was on a level with his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew, however, that he was not examining the carving from the
      standpoint of a critic; and she waited silently for whatever was coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      It came when he ceased his scrutiny of the classical figures in high
      relief, that appeared upon the marble slab.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beatrice, my beloved,&rdquo; said he, and her face brightened. Nothing that
      commenced with the assumption that she was his beloved could be very bad.
      &ldquo;I have been in great trouble&mdash;I am in great trouble still.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was by his side in a moment, and had taken one of his hands in hers.
      She held it, looking up to his face with her eyes full of sympathy and
      concern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dearest,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you are all that is good and gracious. We must
      part, and for ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed, still looking at his face. There really was something
      laughable in the sequence of his words. But her laugh did not make his
      task any easier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I told you that I loved you, Beatrice, I told you the truth,&rdquo; said
      he. &ldquo;If I were to tell you anything else now it would be a falsehood. But
      I had no right ever to speak to you of love. I am absolutely penniless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is no confession,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I knew all along that you were
      dependent upon your father for everything. I felt for you&mdash;so did Mr.
      Airey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Airey?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Mr. Airey mentioned to you that I was a beggar?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he didn&rsquo;t say that. He only said&mdash;what did he say?&mdash;something
      about the affairs of the world being very badly arranged, otherwise you
      should have thousands&mdash;oh, he said he felt for you with all his
      heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;With all his appreciation of the value of an opportunity,&rsquo; he should
      have said. Never mind Edmund Airey. You, yourself, can see, Beatrice, how
      impossible it would be for any man with the least sense of honour,
      situated as I am, to ask you to wait&mdash;to wait for something
      indefinite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did not ask me to wait for anything. You did not ask me to wait for
      your love&mdash;you gave it to me at once. There is nothing indefinite in
      love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Beatrice, you cannot think that I would ask you for your love without
      hoping to marry you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then let us be married to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not laugh, speaking the words. He could see that she would not
      hesitate to marry him at any moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would to heaven that we could be, my dearest! But could there be anything
      more cruel than for a penniless man, such as I am, to ask a girl, such as
      you are, to marry him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot see where the cruelty would be. People have been very happy
      together before now, though they have had very little money between them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Beatrice, you were not meant to pass your life in squalid
      lodgings, with none of the refinements of life around you; and I&mdash;well,
      I have known what roughing it means; I would face the worst alone; but I
      am not selfish enough to seek to drag you down to my level&mdash;to ask
      you to face hardship for my sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not say anything, darling: anything that you may say will only make it
      the harder to part. I can do it, Beatrice; I am strong enough to say
      good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then say it, Harold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stood facing him, with her wonderful eyes looking steadily into his.
      The message that they conveyed to him was such as he could not fail to
      read aright. He knew that if he had said goodbye, he would never have a
      chance of looking into those eyes again.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet he made the attempt to speak&mdash;to say the word that she had
      challenged him to utter. His lips were parted for more than a moment. He
      suddenly dropped her hand&mdash;he had been holding it all the time&mdash;and
      turned away from her with a passionate gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot say it&mdash;God help me! I cannot say good-bye,&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had flung himself into a sofa and had buried his face in his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a short time he had actually felt that he was desirous to part from
      her. For some minutes he had been quite sincere. The force of the words he
      had made use of to show Beatrice how absolutely necessary it was that they
      should part, had not been felt by her; those words had, however, affected
      him. He had felt&mdash;for the first time, in spite of his previous
      self-communing&mdash;that he must say good-bye to her, but he found that
      he was too weak to say it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt a hand upon his shoulder. He could feel her gracious presence near
      to him, before her voice came.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harold,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if you had said it, I should never have had an hour&rsquo;s
      happiness in my life. I would never have seen you again. I felt that all
      the happiness of my life was dependent upon your refraining from speaking
      those words. Cannot you see, my love, that the matter has passed out of
      our hands&mdash;that it is out of our power to part now? Harold, cannot
      you see that, let it be for good or evil&mdash;for heaven or doom&mdash;we
      must be together? Whatever is before us, we are not two but one&mdash;our
      lives are joined beyond the power of separation. I am yours; you are
      mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sprang to his feet. He saw that tears were in her eyes. &ldquo;Let it be so,&rdquo;
       he cried. &ldquo;In God&rsquo;s name let it be so. Whatever may happen, no suggestion
      of parting shall come from me. We stand together, and for ever, Beatrice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For ever and ever,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was how their interview came to a close.
    </p>
    <p>
      Did he know when he had set out for her home that this would be the close
      of their interview&mdash;this clasping of the hands&mdash;this meeting of
      the lips?
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps he did not. But one thing is certain: if it had not had this
      ending, he would have been greatly mortified.
    </p>
    <p>
      His vanity would have received a great blow.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIV.&mdash;ON THE MESSAGE OF THE LILY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>ALKING Westward to
      his rooms, he enjoyed once again the same feeling of exultation, which had
      been his on the evening of the return from the seal-hunt. He felt that she
      was wholly his.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had done all that was in his power to show her how very much better it
      would be for her to part from him and never to see him again&mdash;how
      much better it would be for her to marry the wealthy and distinguished man
      who had, out of the goodness of his heart, expressed to her a deep
      sympathy for his, Harold&rsquo;s, unfortunate condition of dependence upon a
      wicked father. But he had not been able to convince her that it would be
      to her advantage to adopt this course.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, instead of feeling deeply humiliated by reason of the failure of his
      arguments, he felt exultant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is mine&mdash;she is mine!&rdquo; he cried, when he found himself alone in
      his room in St. James&rsquo;s. &ldquo;There is none like her, and she is mine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He reflected for a long time upon her beauty. He thought of Mrs. Mowbray,
      and he smiled, knowing that Beatrice was far lovelier, though her
      loveliness was not of the same impressive type. One did not seem to
      breathe near Beatrice that atmosphere heavy with the scent of roses, which
      Mrs. Mowbray carried with her for the intoxication of the nations. Still,
      the beauty of Beatrice was not a tame thing. It had stirred him, and it
      had stirred other men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, it had stirred Edmund Airey&mdash;he felt certain of it, although he
      did not doubt the truth of Mrs. Mowbray&rsquo;s communication on this subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even though Edmund Airey had been in a plot with Helen, still Harold felt
      that he had been stirred by the beauty of Beatrice.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought over this point for some time, and the conclusion that he came
      to was, that he could easily find out if Edmund meant to play no more
      important a <i>rôle</i> than that of partner in Helen Craven&rsquo;s plot. It
      was perfectly clear, that if Edmund had merely acted as he had done at the
      suggestion of Helen, he would cease to take any further interest in
      Beatrice, unless it was his intention to devote his life to carrying out
      the plot.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of some weeks, he would learn all that could be known on
      this point; but meantime his condition was a peculiar one.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would have felt mortified had he been certain that Edmund Airey had not
      really been stirred by the charm of Beatrice; but he would have been
      somewhat uneasy had he felt certain that Edmund was deeply in love with
      her. He trusted her implicitly&mdash;he felt certain of himself in this
      respect. Had he not a right to trust her, after the way in which she had
      spoken to him&mdash;the way in which she had given herself up to him? But
      then he felt that he had made use of such definite arguments to her, in
      pointing out the advisability of their parting, as caused it to be quite
      possible that she might begin to perceive&mdash;after a year or two of
      waiting&mdash;that there was some value in those arguments of his, after
      all.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time that he had dined with some people, who had sent him a card on
      his return to London, and had subjected himself to the mortifying
      influence of some unfamiliar <i>entrées</i>, and a conversation with a
      woman who was the survivor of the wreck of spiritualism in London, he was
      no longer in the exultant mood of the afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Fool&rsquo;s Paradise&mdash;a Fool&rsquo;s Paradise!&rdquo; he murmured, as he sat in an
      easy-chair, and gazed into his flickering fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been very glorious to think that he was beloved by that exquisite
      girl&mdash;to think of the kisses of her mouth; but whither was the love
      leading him?
    </p>
    <p>
      His father&rsquo;s words could not be forgotten&mdash;those words which he had
      spoken from beneath the eiderdown of his bed at Castle Innisfail; and
      Harold knew that, should he marry Beatrice, his father would certainly
      carry out his threat of cutting off his allowance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus it was that he sat in his chair feeling that, even though Beatrice
      had refused to be separated from him, still they were as completely parted
      by circumstances as if she had immediately acknowledged the force of his
      arguments, and had accepted, his invitation to say good-bye for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus it was that he cried, &ldquo;A Fool&rsquo;s Paradise&mdash;a Fool&rsquo;s Paradise!&rdquo; as
      he thought over the whole matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      What were the exact elements of the Paradise in which his exclamation
      suggested that he was living, he might have had some difficulty in
      defining.
    </p>
    <p>
      But then the site of the original Paradise is still a matter of
      speculation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day he went to take lunch with her and her father&mdash;he had
      promised to do so before he had left her, when they had had their
      interview.
    </p>
    <p>
      It so happened, however, that he only partook of lunch with Beatrice; for
      Mr. Avon had, he learned, been compelled to go to Dublin for some days, to
      satisfy himself regarding a document which was in a library in that city.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harold did not grumble at the prospect of a long afternoon by her side;
      only he could not help feeling that the <i>ménage</i> of the Avon family
      was one of the most remarkable that he had ever known. The historical
      investigations of Mr. Avon did not seem to induce him to take a
      conventional view of his obligations, as the father of an extremely
      handsome girl&mdash;assuming that he was aware of the fact of her beauty&mdash;or
      a pessimistic view of modern society. He seemed to allow Beatrice to be in
      every way her own mistress&mdash;to receive whatever visitors she pleased;
      and to lay no narrow-minded prohibition upon such an incident as lunching
      <i>tête-à-tête</i> with a young man, or perhaps&mdash;but Harold had no
      knowledge of such a case&mdash;an old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wondered if the historian had ever been remonstrated with on this
      subject, by such persons as had not had the advantage of scrutinizing
      humanity through the medium of state papers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harold thought that, on the whole, he had no reason to take exception to
      the liberality of Mr. Avon&rsquo;s system. He reflected that it was to this
      system he was indebted for what promised to be an extremely agreeable
      afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      What he did not reflect upon, however, was, that he was indebted to Mr.
      Avon&rsquo;s peculiarities&mdash;some people would undoubtedly call the system a
      peculiar one&mdash;for a charmingly irresponsible relationship toward the
      historian&rsquo;s daughter. He did not reflect upon the fact, that if the girl
      had had the Average Father, or the Vigilant Mother, to say nothing of the
      Athletic Brother, he would not have been able, without some explanation,
      to visit her, and, on the strength of promising to love her, to kiss her,
      as he had now repeatedly done, on the mouth&mdash;or even on the forehead,
      which is somewhat less satisfying. Everyone knows that the Vigilant Mother
      would, by the application of a maternal thumb-screw which she always
      carries attached to her bunch of keys, have extorted from Beatrice a full
      confession as to the incidents of the seal-hunt&mdash;all except the
      hunting of the seals&mdash;and that this confession would have led to a
      visit to the study of the Average Father, in one corner of which reposes
      the rack, in working order, for the reception of the suitor. Everyone
      knows so much, and also that the alternative of the paternal rack, is the
      fist of the Athletic Brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. Harold Wynne did not seem to reflect upon these points, when he
      heard the lightly uttered excuses of Beatrice for her father&rsquo;s absence, as
      they seated themselves at the table in the large dining-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      His practised eye made him aware of the fact that Beatrice understood what
      he considered to be the essentials of a <i>recherché</i> lunch: a lunch
      appeals to the eye; but wine appeals to other senses than the sense of
      seeing; and the result of his judgment was to convince him that, if Mr.
      Avon was as careless in the affairs of the cellar as he was in the affairs
      of the drawing-room, he was to be congratulated upon having about him
      someone who understood still hock at any rate.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the drawing-room, she busied herself in arranging, in Wedgwood bowls,
      some flowers that he had brought her&mdash;trifles of sprawling orchids,
      Eucharis lilies, and a fairy tropical fern or two, all of which are quite
      easy to be procured in London in October for the expenditure of a few
      sovereigns. The picture that she made bending over her bowls was
      inexpressibly lovely. He sat silent, watching her, while she prattled away
      with the artless high spirits of a child. She was surely the loveliest
      thing yet made by God. He thought of what the pious old writer had said
      about a particular fruit, and he paraphrased it in his own mind, saying,
      that doubtless God could make a lovelier thing, but certainly He had never
      made it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am delighted to have such sweet flowers now,&rdquo; she cried, as she
      observed, with critical eyes, the effect of a bit of flaming crimson&mdash;an
      orchid suggesting a flamingo in flight&mdash;over the turquoise edge of
      the bowl. &ldquo;I am delighted, because I have a prospect of other visitors
      beside yourself, my lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Other visitors?&rdquo; said he. He wondered if he might venture to suggest to
      her the inadvisability of entertaining other visitors during her father&rsquo;s
      absence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Other visitors indeed,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I did not tell you yesterday all
      that I had to tell. I forget now what we talked about yesterday. How did
      we put in our time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked up with laughing eyes across the bowl of flowers, that she held
      up to her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t forget&mdash;I shall never forget,&rdquo; said he, in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must never forget,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;But to my visitors&mdash;who are they,
      do you fancy? Don&rsquo;t try to guess, for if you should succeed I should be
      too mortified to be able to tell you that you were right. I will tell you
      now. Three days ago&mdash;while we were still on the Continent&mdash;Miss
      Craven called. She promised faithfully to do so at Castle Innisfail&mdash;indeed,
      she suggested doing so herself; and I found her card waiting for me on my
      return with a few words scrawled on it, to tell me that she would return
      in some days. I don&rsquo;t think that anything should be in the same bowl with
      a Eucharis lily&mdash;even the Venus-hair fern looks out of place beside
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had strayed from her firebrand orchids to the white lilies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are quite right, indeed,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;A lily and you stand alone&mdash;you
      make everything else in the world seem tawdry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is not the message of the lily,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;But supposing that Miss
      Craven should call upon me to-day&mdash;would you be glad of such a third
      person to our party?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should kill her, if she were a thousand times Helen Craven,&rdquo; said he,
      with a laugh. &ldquo;But she is only one visitor; who are the others?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there is only one other, and he is interesting to me only,&rdquo; she
      cried. &ldquo;Yes, I found Mr. Airey&rsquo;s card also waiting for me, and on it were
      scrawled almost the very words that were on Miss Craven&rsquo;s card, so that he
      may be here at any moment.&rdquo; Harold did not say a word. He sat watching her
      as her hands mingled with their sister-lilies on the table. Something cold
      seemed to have clasped his heart&mdash;a cold doubt that made him dumb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she continued; &ldquo;Mr. Airey asked me one night at Castle Innisfail to
      let him know where we should go after leaving Ireland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he, in a slow way; &ldquo;I heard him make that request of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You heard him? But you were taking part in the <i>tableaux</i> in the
      hall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had left the platform and had strayed round to one of the doors. You
      told him where you were going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told him that we should be in this house in October, and he said that
      he would make it a point to be in town early in October, though Parliament
      was not to sit until the middle of January. He has kept his word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he has kept his word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harold felt that cold hand tightening upon his heart. &ldquo;I think that he was
      interested in me,&rdquo; continued the girl. &ldquo;I know that I was interested in
      him. He knows so much about everything. He is a close friend of yours, is
      he not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Harold, without much enthusiasm. &ldquo;Yes, he was a close friend
      of mine. You see, I had my heart set upon going into Parliament&mdash;upon
      so humble an object may one&rsquo;s aspirations be centred&mdash;and Edmund
      Airey was my adviser.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what did he advise you to do?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He advised me to&mdash;well, to go into Parliament.&rdquo; He could not bring
      himself to tell her what form exactly Edmund Airey&rsquo;s advice had assumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure that his advice was good,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I think that I would go
      to him if I stood in need of advice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you, indeed, Beatrice?&rdquo; said he. He was at the point of telling her
      all that he had learned from Mrs. Mowbray; he only restrained himself by
      an effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe that he is both clever and wise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The two do not always go together, certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They do not. But Mr. Airey is, I think, both.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has been better than either. To be successful is better than to be
      either wise or clever. Mr. Airey has been successful. He will get an
      Under-Secretaryship if the Government survives the want of confidence of
      the Opposition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you will go into Parliament, Harold?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That aspiration is past,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I have chosen the more excellent
      career. Now, tell me something of your aspirations, my beloved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To see you daily&mdash;to be near you&mdash;to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the enumeration of the terms of her aspirations is unnecessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      How was it that some hours after this, Harold Wynne left the house with
      that cold feeling still at his heart?
    </p>
    <p>
      Was it a pang of doubt in regard to Beatrice, or a pang of jealousy in
      regard to Edmund Airey?

      remembered how he had made up his mind to judge whether or not Edmund
      Airey had been simply playing, in respect of Beatrice, the part which,
      according to Mrs. Mowbray&rsquo;s story, had been assigned to him by Helen
      Craven. He had made up his mind that unless Edmund Airey meant to go much
      further than&mdash;according to Mrs. Mowbray&rsquo;s communication&mdash;Helen
      Craven could reasonably ask him to go, he would not take the trouble to
      see Beatrice again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen could scarcely expect him to give up his life to the furtherance of
      her interests with another man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, he had found that Edmund, so far from showing any intention of
      abandoning the position&mdash;it has already been defined&mdash;which he
      had assumed toward Beatrice, had shown, in the plainest possible way, that
      he did not mean to lose sight of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      And for such a man as he was, to mean so much, meant a great deal, Harold
      was forced to acknowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spent the remainder of the day which had begun so auspiciously,
      wondering if his friend, Edmund Airey, meant to tell Beatrice some day
      that he loved her, and, what was very much more important, that he was
      anxious to marry her.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then that unworthy doubt of which he had become conscious, returned to
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Edmund Airey, who, at first, had merely been attracted to Beatrice with
      a view of furthering what Helen Craven believed to be her interests, had
      come to regard her differently&mdash;as he, Harold, assumed that he had&mdash;might
      it not be possible, he asked himself, that Beatrice, who had just admitted
      that she had always had some sort of admiration for Edmund Airey, would&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never, never, never!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;She is all that is good and true and
      faithful. She is mine&mdash;altogether mine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But his mind was in such a condition that the thought which he had tried
      to crush down, remained with him to torture him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It should not have been a torturing thought, considering that, a few days
      before, he had made up his mind that it was his duty to relinquish
      Beatrice&mdash;to go to her and bid her good-bye for ever. To be sure, he
      had failed to realize this honourable intention of his; but what was
      honourable at one time was honourable at another, so that the thought of
      something occurring to bring about the separation for which he had
      professed to be so anxious, should not have been a great trouble to him&mdash;it
      should have been just the contrary.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day found him in the same condition. The thought occurred to him,
      &ldquo;What if, at this very moment, Edmund Airey is with her, endeavouring to
      increase that admiration which he must know Beatrice entertains for him?&rdquo;
       The thought was not a consoling one. Its effect was to make him think very
      severely of the laxity of Mr. Avon&rsquo;s <i>ménage</i>, which would make
      possible such an interview as he had just imagined. It was a terrible
      thing, he thought, for a father to show so utter a disregard for his
      responsibilities as to&mdash;&mdash;-
    </p>
    <p>
      But here he reflected upon something that had occurred to him in
      connection with <i>tête-à-tête</i> interviews, and he thought it better
      not to pursue his course of indignant denunciation of the eminent
      historian.
    </p>
    <p>
      He put on an overcoat and went to pay a visit to his sister, who, he had
      heard the previous day, was in town for a short time. In another week she
      would be entertaining a large party for the pheasant-shooting at her
      country-house in Brackenshire, and Harold was to be her guest as well as
      Edmund Airey and Helen Craven. It was to this visit that Lord Fotheringay
      had alluded in the course of his chamber interview with his son at Castle
      Innisfail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harold had now made up his mind that he would not be able to join his
      sister&rsquo;s party, and he thought it better to tell her so than to write to
      her to this effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Lampson was not at home, the servant said, when he had knocked at the
      door of the house in Eaton Square. A party was expected for lunch,
      however, so that she would probably return within half an hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harold said he would wait for his sister, and went upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was one person already in the drawingroom and that person was Lord
      Fotheringay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harold greeted him, and found that he was in an extremely good humour. He
      had never been in better health, he declared. He felt, he said, as young
      as the best of them&mdash;he prudently refrained from defining them&mdash;and
      he was still of the opinion that the Home&mdash;the dear old English Home&mdash;was
      where true and lasting happiness alone was to be found; and he meant to
      try the Principality of Monaco later on; for November was too awful in any
      part of Britain. Yes, he had seen the influence of the Home upon exiles in
      various parts of the world. Had he not seen strong men weep like children&mdash;like
      innocent children&mdash;at the sight of an English post-mark&mdash;the
      post-mark of a simple English village? Why had they wept, he asked his
      son, with the well-gloved forefinger of the professional moralist
      outstretched?
    </p>
    <p>
      His son declined to hazard an answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had wept those tears&mdash;those bitter tears&mdash;Lord Fotheringay
      said, with solemn emphasis, because their thoughts went back to that
      village home of theirs&mdash;the father, the mother, perhaps a sister&mdash;who
      could tell?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, my boy,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;Mid pleasures and palaces&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;&rsquo;mid
      pleasures and&rsquo;&mdash;by the way, I looked in at the Rivoli Palace last
      night. I heard that there was a woman at that place who did a new dance. I
      saw it. A new dance! My dear boy, it wasn&rsquo;t new when I saw it first, and
      that&rsquo;s&mdash;ah, never mind&mdash;it&rsquo;s some years ago. I was greatly
      disappointed with it. There&rsquo;s nothing indecent in it&mdash;I will say that
      for it&mdash;but there&rsquo;s nothing enlivening. Ah, the old home of burlesque&mdash;the
      old home&mdash;that&rsquo;s what I was talking about&mdash;the Home&mdash;the
      sentiment of the Home&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of burlesque?&rdquo; suggested Harold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of the devil, sir,&rdquo; said his father. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try to be clever; it&rsquo;s nearly
      as bad as being insolent. What about that girl&mdash;Helen Craven, I mean?
      Have you seen her since you came to town? She&rsquo;s here. She&rsquo;ll be at Ella&rsquo;s
      next week. Perhaps it will be your last chance. Heavens above! To think
      that a pauper like you should need to be urged to marry such a girl! A
      girl with two hundred thousand pounds in cash&mdash;a girl belonging to
      one of the best families in all&mdash;in all Birmingham. Harold, don&rsquo;t be
      a fool! Such a chance doesn&rsquo;t come every day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then Mrs Lampson entered the room and with her, her latest discovery,
      the Coming Dramatist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Lampson was invariably making discoveries. But they were mostly
      discoveries of quartz; they contained a certain proportion of gold, to be
      sure; but when it came to the crushing, they did not yield enough of the
      precious metal to pay the incidental expenses of the plant for the
      working.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had discovered poets and poetesses&mdash;the latter by the score. She
      had discovered at least one Genius in black and white&mdash;his genius
      being testified by his refusal to work; and she had discovered a
      pianoforte Genius&mdash;his genius being proved by the dishevelment of his
      hair. The man who had the reputation for being the Greatest Living Atheist
      was a welcome guest at her house, and the most ridiculous of living
      socialists boasted of having dined at her table.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was foremost in every philanthropic movement, and wrote articles to
      the magazines, lamenting the low tone of modern society in London.
    </p>
    <p>
      She also sneered (in private) at Lady Innisfail. Her latest discovery, the
      Coming Dramatist, had had, he proudly declared, his plays returned to him
      by the best managers in London, and by the one conscientious manager in
      the United States&mdash;the last mentioned had not prepaid the postage, he
      lamented.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a fearful joy to cherish; but Mrs. Lampson listened to his egotism
      at lunch, and tried to prevent her other guests from listening to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      They would not understand him, she thought, and she did not make a mistake
      in this matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      She got rid of him as soon as possible, and once more breathed freely. He
      had not disgraced her&mdash;that was so much in his favour. The same could
      not always be said of her discoveries.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Christian Dynamitard was, people said, the only gentleman who had ever
      been introduced ta society by Mrs. Lampson.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Harold found his sister alone, he explained to her that it would be
      impossible for him to join her party at Abbeylands&mdash;Mr. Lampson&rsquo;s
      Bracken-shire place&mdash;and his sister laughed and said she supposed
      that he had something better on his hands. He assured her that he had
      nothing better, only&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, there,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to invent an excuse. You would
      only have met people whom you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Harold, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re not foolish enough to ask your
      discoveries down to shoot pheasants. I should like to see some of them in
      a <i>battue</i> with my best enemies. Yes, I&rsquo;d hire a window, with
      pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t he behave well&mdash;the Coming Dramatist?&rdquo; said she, earnestly.
      &ldquo;You cannot say he didn&rsquo;t behave well&mdash;at least for a Coming Person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He behaved&mdash;wonderfully,&rdquo; said Harold. &ldquo;Good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She followed him to the door of the room&mdash;nay, outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the bye,&rdquo; said she, in a whisper; &ldquo;do you know anything of a Miss
      Avon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Avon?&rdquo; said Harold. &ldquo;Miss Avon. Why, if she is the daughter of
      Julius Anthony Avon, the historian, we met her at Castle Innisfail. Why do
      you ask me, Ella?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is so funny,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Yesterday Mr. Airey called upon me, and
      before he left he begged of me to call upon her, and even hinted&mdash;he
      has got infinite tact&mdash;that she would make a charming addition to our
      party at Abbeylands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Harold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And just now papa has been whispering to me about this same Miss Avon. He
      commanded me&mdash;papa has no tact&mdash;to invite her to join us for a
      week. I wonder what that means.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What what means?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&mdash;Mr. Airey and papa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great Heaven! Ella, what should it mean, except that two men, for whom we
      have had a nominal respect, have gone over to the majority of fools?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, is that all? I was afraid that&mdash;ah, good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVI.&mdash;ON THE INFLUENCE OF A MAN OF THE WORLD.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t was true then&mdash;what
      he had surmised was true! Edmund Airey had shown himself to be actuated by
      a stronger impulse than a desire to assist Helen Craven to realize her
      hopes&mdash;so much appeared perfectly plain to Harold Wynne, as he
      strolled back to his rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was now convinced that Edmund Airey was serious in his attitude in
      respect of Beatrice. At Castle Innisfail he had been ready enough to play
      the game with counters, on his side at least, as stakes, but now he meant
      to play a serious game.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harold recalled what proofs he had already received, to justify his
      arriving at this conclusion, and he felt that they were ample&mdash;he
      felt that this conclusion was the only one possible to be arrived at by
      anyone acquainted with all that had come under his notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was quite astounded to hear from his sister that Edmund Airey had taken
      so extreme a step as to beg of her to call upon Beatrice, and invite her
      to join the Abbeylands party. Whether or not he had approached Mrs.
      Lampson in confidence on this matter, the fact of his having approached
      her was, in some degree, compromising to himself, and no one was better
      aware of this fact than Edmund Airey. He was not an eager boy to give way
      to a passion without counting the cost. There was no more subtle
      calculator of costs than Edmund Airey, and Harold knew it.
    </p>
    <p>
      What, then, was left for Harold to infer?
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing, except what he had already inferred.
    </p>
    <p>
      What then was left for him to do to checkmate the man who was menacing
      him?
    </p>
    <p>
      He had lived so long in that world, the centre of which is situated
      somewhere about Park Lane, and he had come to believe so thoroughly that
      the leading characteristic of this world is worldliness, that he had lost
      the capacity to trust anyone implicitly. He was unable to bring himself to
      risk everything upon the chance of Beatrice&rsquo;s loving him, in the face of
      the worst that might occur.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus it was that the little feeling of distrust which he experienced the
      previous day remained with him. It did not increase, but it was there. Now
      and again he could feel its cold finger upon his heart, and he knew that
      it was there.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not love with that blind, unreasoning, uncalculating love&mdash;that
      love which knows only heaven and hell, not earth. That perfect love, which
      casteth out distrust, was not the love of his world.
    </p>
    <p>
      And thus it was that he walked to his rooms, thinking by what means he
      could bind that girl to him, so that she should be bound beyond the
      possibility of chance, or craft, or worldliness coming between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not arrived at any satisfactory conclusion on this subject when he
      reached his rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was surprised to find waiting for him Mr. Playdell, but he greeted the
      man cordially&mdash;he had acquired a liking for him, for he perceived
      that, with all his eccentricities&mdash;all his crude theories that he
      tried to vivify by calling them principles, he was still acting faithfully
      toward Archie Brown, and was preventing him from squandering hundreds of
      pounds where Archie might have squandered thousands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are naturally surprised to see me, Mr. Wynne,&rdquo; said Playdell. &ldquo;I dare
      say that most men would think that I had taken a liberty in making an
      uninvited call like this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, at any rate, think nothing of the sort, Mr. Playdell,&rdquo; said Harold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am certain that you do not,&rdquo; said Mr. Play-dell. &ldquo;I am certain that you
      are capable of doing me justice&mdash;yes, on some points.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope that I am, Mr. Playdell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that you are, Mr. Wynne. You are not one of those silly persons,
      wise in their own conceit, who wink at one another when my name is
      mentioned, and suggest that the unfrocked priest is making a very fair
      thing out of his young patron.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe that your influence over him is wholly for good, Mr. Playdell.
      If he were to allow you the income of a Bishop instead of that of a Dean I
      believe that he would still save money&mdash;a great deal of money&mdash;by
      having you near him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you are in no way astray, Mr. Wynne. I was prepared for what people
      would say when I accepted the situation that Archie offered me, but the
      only stipulation that I made was that my accounts were to be audited by a
      professional man, and monthly. Thus it is that I protect myself. Every
      penny that I receive is accounted for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a very wise plan, Mr. Playdell, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it has nothing to do with my coming here to-day? That is what you are
      too polite to say. You are right, Mr. Wynne. I have not come here to talk
      about myself and my systems, but about our friend Archie. You have great
      influence over him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I haven&rsquo;t much. If I had, I wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate to tell him that
      he is making an ass of himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have come to the point at once, Mr. Wynne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Playdell had risen from his chair and was walking up and down the room
      with his head bent. Now he stood opposite to Harold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The point?&rdquo; said Harold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The point is that he is being robbed right and left through the medium of
      the Legitimate Theatre, and a stop must be put to it,&rdquo; said Playdell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you think that I should make the attempt to put a stop to this
      foolishness of his? My dear Mr. Playdell, if I were to suggest to Archie
      that he is making an ass of himself over this particular matter, I should
      never have another chance of exercising my influence over him for good or
      bad. I have always known that Mrs. Mowbray is one of the most expensive
      tastes in England. But when the beauty of Mrs. Mowbray is to be exploited
      with the beauty of the poetry of Shakespeare, and when these gems are
      enclosed in so elaborate a setting as the Legitimate Theatre&mdash;well, I
      suppose Archie&rsquo;s millions will hold out. There&rsquo;s a deal of spending in
      three millions, Mr. Playdell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His millions will hold out,&rdquo; said Mr. Playdell. &ldquo;And so will he,&rdquo; laughed
      Harold. &ldquo;I have known Mrs. Mowbray for several years, and she has never
      ruined any man except her husband, and he is not worth talking about. She
      has always liked young men with wealth so enormous that even her powers of
      spending money can make no impression on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Wynne, you can have no notion what that theatre has cost Archie&mdash;what
      it is daily costing him. Eight hundred pounds a week wouldn&rsquo;t cover the
      net loss of that ridiculous business&mdash;that trailing of Shakespeare in
      the mire, to gratify the vanity of a woman. I know what men are when they
      are very young. If I were to talk to Archie seriously on this subject, he
      would laugh at me; if he did not, he would throw something at me. The
      result would be <i>nil</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unless he was a good shot with a casual missile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Wynne, he would not listen to me; but he would listen to you&mdash;I
      know that he would. You could talk to him with all the authority of a man
      of the world&mdash;a man in Society.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Playdell,&rdquo; said Harold, shaking his head, &ldquo;if there&rsquo;s no fool like
      the old fool, there&rsquo;s no ass like the young ass. Now, I can assure you, on
      the authority of a man of the world&mdash;you know what such an authority
      is worth&mdash;that to try and detach Archie from his theatre nonsense
      just now by means of a lecture, would be as impossible as to detach a
      limpet from a rock by a sermon on&mdash;let us say&mdash;the flexibility
      of the marriage bond.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! alas!&rdquo; said Mr. Playdell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The only way that Archie can be induced to throw over Mrs. Mowbray and
      Shakespeare and suchlike follies, is by inducing him to form a stronger
      attachment elsewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The last state of that man might be worse than the first, Mr. Wynne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Might&mdash;yes, it might be, but that is no reason why it should be. The
      young ass takes to thistles, because it has never known the enjoyment of a
      legitimate pasture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The legitimate pasture is some distance away from the Legitimate Theatre,
      Mr. Wynne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I agree with you. Now, the thought has just occurred to me that I might
      get Archie brought among decent people, for the first time in his life. My
      sister, Mrs. Lampson, is having a party down at her husband&rsquo;s place in
      Brackenshire, for the pheasant-shooting. Why shouldn&rsquo;t Archie be one of
      the party? There are a number of decent men going, and decent women also.
      None of the men will try to get the better of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the women will not try to make a fool of him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t promise that&mdash;the world can&rsquo;t cease to revolve on its axis
      because Archie Brown has a tendency to giddiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Playdell was grave. Then he said, thoughtfully, &ldquo;Whatever the women
      may be, they can&rsquo;t be of the stamp of Mrs. Mowbray.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may trust my sister for that. You may also trust her to see that they
      are less beautiful than Mrs. Mowbray,&rdquo; remarked Harold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Playdell pondered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pheasant-shooting is expensive in its way,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;The preservation of
      grouse runs away with a good deal of money also, I am told. Race horses,
      it is generally understood, entail considerable outlay. Put them all
      together, and you only come within measurable distance of Mrs. Mowbray and
      Shakespeare as a pastime&mdash;with nothing to show for the money&mdash;absolutely
      nothing to show for the money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Except Mrs. Mowbray and Shakespeare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Wynne, I believe that your kind suggestion may be the saving of that
      lad,&rdquo; said Playdell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s the merest chance,&rdquo; said Harold. &ldquo;He may grow sick of the whole
      business after the first <i>battue</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ve known men saved from destruction by scoring a century in a
      first-class cricket match: they gave themselves up to cricket, to the
      exclusion of other games less healthy. If Archie takes kindly to the
      pheasants, he may make up his mind to buy a place and preserve them. That
      will be a healthy occupation for him. You will give him to understand that
      it&rsquo;s the proper thing to do, Mr. Wynne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may depend upon me. I&rsquo;ll write to my sister to invite him. It&rsquo;s only
      an experiment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will succeed, Mr. Wynne&mdash;it will succeed, I feel that it will. If
      you only knew, as I do, how he is being fooled, you would understand my
      earnestness&mdash;you have long ago forgiven my intrusion. Give me a
      chance of serving you in return, Mr. Wynne. That&rsquo;s all I ask.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVII.&mdash;ON THE DEFECTIVE LINK.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>AROLD had a note
      written to Mrs. Lampson, begging her to invite his friend, Mr. Archie
      Brown, to join her party at Abbeylands, almost before Mr. Playdell had
      left the street. He knew that his sister would be very glad to have
      Archie. All the world had a general notion of Archie&rsquo;s millions; and
      Abbeylands was one of those immense houses that can accommodate a
      practically unlimited number of guests. The property had been bought from
      a nobleman, who had been brought to the verge of bankruptcy by trying to
      maintain it. Mr. Lampson, a patriotic American, had come to his relief,
      and had taken the place off his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      That is what all truly patriotic Americans do when they have an
      opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new-world democracy comes to the rescue of the old-world aristocracy,
      and thus a venerable institution is preserved from annihilation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harold posted his letter as he went out to dine with a man who was a
      member of the Carlton Club, and zealous in heating up recruits for the
      Conservative party. He thought that Harold might possibly be open to
      conviction, not, of course, on the question of the righteousness of
      certain principles, but on the question of the direction in which the cat
      was about to jump. The jumping cat is the dominant power in modern
      politics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harold ate his dinner, and listened patiently to the man whose
      acquaintance with the tendencies of every genus of the political <i>felis</i>
      was supposed to be extraordinary. He said little. Before he had gone to
      Castle Innisfail the subject would have interested him greatly, but now he
      thought that Archie Brown&rsquo;s inanities were preferable to those of the
      politician.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was just enough to acknowledge, however, that the cigar with which he
      left the Carlton was as good a one as he had ever smoked. So that there
      was some advantage in being a Conservative after all.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked round St. James&rsquo;s Square, for the night was warm and fine. His
      mind was not conscious of having received anything during the previous two
      hours upon which it would be profitable to ponder. He thought over the
      question which he had put to himself previously&mdash;the question of how
      he could bind Beatrice to him&mdash;how he could make her certainly his
      own, and thus banish that cold distrust of which he now and again became
      aware&mdash;no, it was not exactly distrust, it was only a slightly
      defective link in the chain of complete trust.
    </p>
    <p>
      She loved him and she promised to love him. He reflected upon this, and he
      asked himself what more could he want. What bond stronger than her word
      could he desire to have?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I will trust her for ever&mdash;for ever,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;If she is
      not true, then there never was truth on earth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He fancied that he had dismissed the matter from his mind with this
      exorcism.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so he had.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it so happens that some persons are so constituted that there is but
      the slenderest connection between their mind and their heart. Something
      that appeals very forcibly to their mind will not touch their heart in the
      least. They are Nature&rsquo;s &ldquo;sports.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harold Wynne was one of these people. He had made up his mind that, on the
      question of implicitly trusting Beatrice, nothing more remained to be
      said. There was still, however, that cold finger upon his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      But having made up his mind that nothing more remained to be said on the
      question, he was logical enough&mdash;for logic is also a mental
      attribute, though by no means universally distributed&mdash;to think of
      other matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      He began to think about Mr. Playdell, and his zeal for the reform of
      Archie. Harold&rsquo;s respect for Mr. Playdell had materially increased since
      the morning. At first he had been inclined to look with suspicion upon the
      man who had, by the machinery of the Church, been prohibited from
      discharging the functions of a priest of that Church, though, of course,
      he was free to exercise that unimportant function known as preaching. He
      could not preach within a church, however. If he wished to try and save
      souls by preaching, that was his own business. He would not do so with the
      sanction of the Church. He was anxious to save the soul of Archie Brown,
      at any rate. He assumed that Archie had a soul in embryo, ready to be
      hatched, and it was clear to Harold that Mr. Playdell was anxious to save
      it from being addled before it had pecked its way out of its shell.
      Therefore Harold had a considerable respect for Mr. Playdell, though he
      had been one of the unprofitable servants of the Church.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought of the earnest words of the man&mdash;of the earnest way in
      which he had begged to be given the chance of returning the service, which
      he believed was about to be done to him by Harold.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been greatly in earnest; but that fact only made his words the more
      ridiculous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What service could he possibly do me?&rdquo; Harold thought, when he had had
      his laugh, recalling the outstretched hand of Mr. Playdell, and his eager
      eyes. &ldquo;<i>What service could he possibly do me? What service?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was rooted to the pavement. The driver of a passing hansom pulled up
      opposite him, taking the fact of his stopping so suddenly as an indication
      that he wanted a hansom.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took no notice of the hansom, and it passed up the square. He remained
      so long lost in thought, that his cigar, so strongly impregnated with
      sound Conservative principles, went out like any Radical weed, or the
      penny Pickwick of the Labour Processionist.
    </p>
    <p>
      He dropped the unsmoked end, and felt for his pocket-handkerchief. He
      raised his hat and wiped his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he took a stroll into Piccadilly and on to Knightsbridge. He went
      down Sloane Street, and into Chelsea, returning by the Embankment to
      Westminster&mdash;the clock was chiming the hour of 2 a.m. as he passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the same clock had struck three before he got into bed, and five
      before he fell asleep.

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
